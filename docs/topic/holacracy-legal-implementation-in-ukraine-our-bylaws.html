  <dd>Hi, We are starting LLC in Ukraine in the industry of software development. After consulting with Ukrainian companies, which work according to Holacracy, and Ukrainian lawers looks like no-one have thought about bylaw Holacracy implementation seriously. Also it is understandable that this is absolutely possible to do via our LLC (with a legal director/holacratic-leadlink in the head) and self-employed partners.

<p>Hi Georgiy,</p><p>I cannot answer your question directly but the guys at&nbsp;<a href="https://encode.org/" target="_blank">https://encode.org/</a> are working with what they call a "For-Purpose Enterprise" which also takes into account altering the operating agreement and implementing dynamic equity split calculation to&nbsp;interface&nbsp;Holacracy with old law-structure. I don't know if you heard about this but if not then it would be a good place to look for some info on this.</p><p>Also you can check out a webinar by Encode on this topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBGy7IkDirY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Upgrading Legal Structure</a>.</p><p>Hope this helps. Best regards!</p>      </ul>
