  <dd>Circle membership and meetings - size</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I am grappling with the idea of converting an existing team structure into a holacracy - the team is very big - 20 or more people in it and they work across shifts. Does it matter how big the circle is - does it get to unwieldy at a certain number? Do you expect every one in a circle (or team) to attend all the governance and tactical meetings, even if it is a large circle - say 20 or more people?? I would love your advise, insights and ideas on how I might handle this.</dd>
