      <h4>Can a lead link throw out some one</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I am wondering that since lead link can assign roles to people, and if they dont see some one fit to do a role they can take them out of it. Imagining a scenario where the lead link thinks that some one is not performing in different roles, and take them out of all the roles.&nbsp;In the end, since the person has no role, wont they have to leave the organisation. I am not saying this is right or wrong, but trying to understand what is it. I see this power having advantages and could create challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Has any one acted themselves as a lead link in this way when they found the person was not fit to do any role and the person had to leave?&nbsp;</p>    </div>
