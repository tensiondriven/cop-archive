  <dd>Hello!! I am currently the facilitator for multiple organizations and am looking to up my game. I'm wondering - do any of you belong to an organization that is: Fairly seasoned in their practice of Holacracy Has virtual tactical meetings Would be willing to let me observe the meetings so I can learn through osmosis? If so, please reach out to me. Thank you so much!! --Ruth Gerhard</dd>

<p>We at Purely Poultry have been a Holacracy powered organization since 2015, have virtual tactical meetings, and would love to have you observe our meetings.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
