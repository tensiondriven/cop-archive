  <dd>Creating a role in more than one team</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I'm sort of assuming that it is impossible to create a role in more than one team unless you are a member of all of those teams? Is the closest you can get to this creating an accountability for each of the teams in GCC and then allowing them to decide how to deal with that?</dd>

<p>Per 2.6.1:&nbsp;</p><p>A Circle may also move its own Defined Roles or Policies into a Sub-Circle, or move any from within the Sub-Circle into itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you felt it necessary, I believe the first part of this clause would allow someone to create a role at the Super-Circle and then push that role into a Sub-Circle.&nbsp; This is clearly just one of many possible solutions to your tension&nbsp;@davidlp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am curious to hear how the tension is resolved!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Yes, to propose a role in any Circle (team), one must already be a "Core Circle Member" of that team. (See <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art23" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 2.3</a>.)&nbsp;Note that, per <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 2.3.4</a>, the Lead Link is empowered to make special appointments to the Core Circle, <em>i.e.</em>, special appointees need not hold a defined Role as <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art231" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 2.3.1</a> requires.</p><p>Once a person is a Core Circle Member, they may make a proposal to create a Role in a Governance meeting. It is then at the Lead Link's discretion as to who should fill that Role, if anyone. (Unless the Circle has a Policy per <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 2.2.3</a> that specifies an alternate process for mapping Roles to people, thereby removing that Domain from the Lead Link.)</p>      </ul>

<p>I see a few pathways:</p><p>In our&nbsp;organization&nbsp;we have coaches and mentors for specific things at the GCC level that all circles have access to call on when needed. (NVC, GTD, Holacracy)</p><p>Like you originally said, You could make an accountability for each subcircle to support Asana use within the circle. Then subcircles can do that how they see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Or you could have an Asana Disciple at the GCC level and co-fill it with someone from each of the groups you think might benefit from support.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing we do is draft governance then offer it to the groups so one classroom adopted a parent communication role and shared the success of the new role with their colleagues and within a month each classroom had developed some version of it not because they had to but when someone named that tension and solution they thought it would be helpful in their circle too.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope those pathways are helpful.</p><p>Jenn</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:577633875651499938]. What is the Tension behind your question? Maybe there is another pathway that will help you.</p>      </ul>

<p>Good question! We’re providing Asana to the whole team and it seemed like a good idea to have an ‘Asana Disciple’ role in each team to help support the process.</p>      </ul>
