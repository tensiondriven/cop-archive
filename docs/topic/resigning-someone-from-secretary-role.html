      <h4>Resigning someone from Secretary role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all!</p><p>I am LL at Evolving Organisation and our secretary has asked to be resigned from the role. I have not been able to do this in Glassfrog. Does anyone know if there is a process for resigning someone from secretary? I know there needs to be an election to assign secretary role but unsure about resigning. Thank you!</p><p>Sally</p>    </div>

<p>Thanks Bernard, do you have to have a specific authority in GF to change the secretary? At the moment I am unable to select the role to change the person who energises it. I have admin authority in GF and can allocate non-core roles without any problem. Hmmmm...</p>      </div>

<p>There is no process for resigning someone from secretary - the only way I know is that a circle member asks for a new election...&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>In the case where the Secretary is too busy and needs to resign from the role is&nbsp;I've asked them if they wanted me to schedule a governance meeting on their behalf and call for new elections. I don't think there's anything that says Secretary has to be the one to schedule meetings, but I like to check to avoid conflicts. We then have the governance meeting as normal, using the normal proxy rules for acting secretary when secretary isn't there, and we start with the elections, or just do the elections if we can only have a short meeting. I typically have done this as LL&nbsp;since I'll have to do something about it at some point, but I guess any circle member could also do it, though I recommend communicating that you're scheduling a governance meeting as a proxy or whatever so that circle members aren't confused about what's going on.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Sally! Since elections happen in governance, you'll want to open a new governance meeting for the circle and hold an election for a new Secretary. Any circle member (or admins) is able to open a meeting in GlassFrog, but since Secretary is an elected role, GlassFrog expects you to elect someone new.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to contact us via the website if you need help with it or better direction!&nbsp;<a href="http://glassfrog.com/contact/" target="_blank"><a href="http://glassfrog.com/contact/" target="_blank">http://glassfrog.com/contact/</a></a>.</p>      </div>

<p>There are two different issues in the question, if I understand correctly: One about the Secretary resigning,&nbsp;another about Glassfrog being unable to process that.</p><p>In my view, a Secretary can resign their role, just like any other role holder. There is nothing in the constitution that would suggest otherwise. When that happens, a surrogate may fill the role. (2.3.4&nbsp;on Resigning, 2.5.4 for Surrogates)</p><p>Glassfrog is currently unable to process that, so until a new Secretary is elected, the Governance records will&nbsp;show wrong (outdated) information.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>      </div>
