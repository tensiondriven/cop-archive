  <dd>Resigning someone from Secretary role</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi all! I am LL at Evolving Organisation and our secretary has asked to be resigned from the role. I have not been able to do this in Glassfrog. Does anyone know if there is a process for resigning someone from secretary? I know there needs to be an election to assign secretary role but unsure about resigning. Thank you! Sally</dd>
