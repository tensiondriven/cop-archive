  <dd>Hello all, If a circle member has tensions within the circle, however, the lead link of the circle is not giving those tensions enough attention, what can be done here? These tensions have been raised quite a few times and they should be resolved within the circle. I don't think using a rep link here is a good approach as they don't touch other circles. Just wondering how Holacracy solves this kind of problem. Thanks, Xuan</dd>
