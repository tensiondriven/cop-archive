  <dd>Tricky Tension: can't capture tactical outputs for role if not engaged before meeting</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Attended a tactical today, and raised a tension: "As Prospect Deployment, engaging Role A &amp; Role B - would be helpful to know when the next email blasts are going out." Role A was present, and told me probably in a week for her blasts. Role B was not present, so asked the Secretary to capture a next-action for Role B: "Update Prospect Deployment regarding next prospect blast date". After the meeting, Role B expressed frustration: "It feels like under the guise of bringing 'visibility'...</dd>

<p>HI Fred,</p><p>my two cents:</p><p>Article <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art424" target="_blank">4.2.4</a>&nbsp;indicates what should happen when a role does not show up in tactical, and that's part of a shared ruleset that really makes this sentence sound weird &gt;&nbsp;"It feels like under the guise of bringing 'visibility' you end up insinuating that people aren’t fulfilling their roles.&nbsp;I think it makes it feel weirdly hostile if things like that surface for the very first time in the context of a public meeting."</p><p>Article <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art412" target="_blank">4.1.2(b)</a>&nbsp;which is mentioned by 4.2.4 still gives role B a chance to refuse to take on the action by explaining the reason why she shouldn't, she could always then come up with a tension in governance, I wonder if she would really be able to attach such a tension to a specific role with a valid example.</p><p>the kind of reasoning she's bringing to the table: (not being at ease with objections/considering tactical as "public meeetings where your reputation is at stake) really screams for&nbsp;&nbsp;some &nbsp;coaching in my opinion.</p><p>this proposal:&nbsp;"no next action or project can be captured for a role unless they’ve been engaged before the meeting, or are present during the meeting” does not sound valid to me, because it conflicts with aforementioned article, by limiting what a tactical meeting could accomplish.</p><p>And that without even looking at the tension behind it (assuming it would be the one she informally expressed &nbsp;"insinuating that people aren’t fulfilling their roles" which is clearly a personal tension).</p><p>I'm curious to find out what others think about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Agree with Andrea and to add to it, instead of capturing the following action: “Role B: "Update Prospect Deployment regarding next prospect blast date".”, I would rather 1- capture a project for the next email blast to have visibility on it and 2- capture an action&nbsp;“Role B: Give a projection to Prospect Deployment about the project “Next Email Blast sent””.</p><p>The coaching you can give is in the constitution, duties of a circle member section 4.1.1:</p><h4>4.1.1 Duty of Transparency</h4><p>You have a duty to provide transparency when requested by your fellow Circle Members, in any of the following areas:</p><ul><li><strong>(c) Projections:</strong> You must provide a projection of the date you expect to complete any Project or Next-Action tracked for any of your Roles in the Circle. A rough estimate is sufficient, considering your current context and priorities, but without detailed analysis or planning. This projection is not a binding commitment in any way, and unless Governance says otherwise, you have no duty to track the projection, manage your work to achieve it, or follow-up with the recipient if something changes.</li></ul>      </ul>
