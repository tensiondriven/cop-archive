      <h4>Latest Facilitator Guide different from PDF</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Just purchased and received latest laminated Facilitator Guides - and there is slight discrepancy between hard copy and posted PDF on Tactical card. On the back '5 Pathways' the title of the last two are different.</p><p>Print: Request Space To Share&nbsp;<br />PDF: Share Information</p><p>Print: Request An Ongoing Expectation<br />PDF: Try To Set A New Expectation</p><p>The differences are minor but things like this make my face hurt.&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_crazy.gif" title="crazy" /></p><p>Which is 'correct' according to whoever made the latest update?</p><p>If the PDF is correct I'd like a replacement card that matches it.<br />If the printed card is correct please update the PDF as soon as possible to match it.</p><p>I refer to these materials a great deal as I help newbies learn, and have found it very challenging when the 'summary guides' are in conflict.</p><p>Help?</p>    </div>

<p>[@mention:454478741268114544]&nbsp;Thanks for pointing that out. My role updates the meeting cards, and my usual plan of updating content in small steps seems to be causing confusion (so you're definitely not the only one feeling that).&nbsp;</p><p>My plan going forward is to have iteration releases every 6 months to avoid this. In this case, the print version is the most updated, and I'll make sure to get the PDF version updated as well.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you - I think very wise to link the action - that when the new print version is made available, to make PDF available.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:456308404254624012]&nbsp;Completely agreed! I've actually added version numbers to the last few iterations of governance cards, but the tactical only had one small change, which is the one that caused the issue. The old one is the last one to NOT have a version number. : )&nbsp;</p>      </div>
