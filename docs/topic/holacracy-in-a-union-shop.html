  <dd>I am curious, has Holacracy been enacted in a Union setting in the USA?</dd>

<p>Al, I am not aware of that in the US yet, though I think Arca is probably entering into that territory in Italy if they have not already.</p><p>There is also some ground work being laid in the Washington State government as we continue our work there, so we may &nbsp;know more later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe we can map the union needs into the Holacracy governance structure and take that as a starting point.</p><p>The broader questions and needs around unions are really interesting with huge potential obstacles and transformation possibilities in my mind.
