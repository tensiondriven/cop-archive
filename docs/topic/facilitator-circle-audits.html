  <dd>Facilitator Circle Audits</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi all, As you know, the facilitator role is accountable for "auditing the meetings and records of sub-circles . . ." Does anyone have a template for doing this? In particular, I'd love to have: A template document for the facilitator to fill out detailing his/her findings Best practices or tips for the facilitator (how to audit, how often to audit, how to report back to the sub- and parent-circle about the audit, etc) I am surprised that this does not seem to have come up on the forum...</dd>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;[@mention:476716727643924128]:</p><p>Don't have the answers, and am interested to hear some solutions from people who has done this.</p><p>Just wanted to say thank you for bringing this up. &nbsp;It's right there in the accountabilities of facilitator all this time, but somehow it doesn't register quite well in our minds. We have always thought that it only gets triggered when "someone" declares a process breakdown.</p><p>Well, that someone is the facilitator of the super-circle ��. No wonder nobody ever declares "Process breakdown". Nobody ever audits the subcircles in our org.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Dien,</p><p>Where are you located?&nbsp; Gerald is in central Europe, so we'd probably target something in the neighborhood of 12pm ET / 6pm CET.&nbsp; Send me a private message if interested.</p><p>Kevin</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p><p>dealing with the same issue at the moment, but have no template yet.</p><p>My thoughts are very much around creating a guide with process steps to follow through (similar to a GTD weekly review).&nbsp;</p><p>Interested to schedule a call to&nbsp;ramp something up?</p><p>- Gerald&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
