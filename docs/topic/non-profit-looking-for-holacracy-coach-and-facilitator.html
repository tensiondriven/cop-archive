      <h4>Non Profit looking for Holacracy Coach &amp; Facilitator</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello Holacracy Community of Practice!!</p><div>I just resigned from the board of a non-profit in order to pursue other things.&nbsp;</div><div>As a group they are exploring implementing Holacracy - they haven't dived full in yet - they have roles, are using GlassFrog and I've been slowly working with them in training them on how the system works.&nbsp; I've been acting as Facilitator and coach.&nbsp; As I'm stepping away I'm looking for someone to replace me as their guide and facilitator in this process.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It's a really awesome group of people up to some incredible things. Their mission is to support and empower entrepreneurs in the Congo and Sub-Saharan Africa by creating local community run programs that support people with passion in creating successful businesses.&nbsp; It's already running and successful in three communities in the Congo and all their neighboring communities are asking the people there to train them - which is where we come in - in supporting the spread of this training. (If you wanna see more, here is our website...)&nbsp; &nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://sowilo.co/" target="_blank">http://<span class="m_-4038144798475370585gmail-il">sowilo</span>.co/</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Here is the man whose model we are using...</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/ernesto_sirolli_want_to_help_someone_shut_up_and_listen" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/<wbr />ernesto_sirolli_want_to_help_<wbr />someone_shut_up_and_listen</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you are interested in supporting small business in Africa and supporting a group in learning Holacracy, please reach out to me and I can connect you to them.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The board meeting is held on zoom (everyone is remote) and it's every Wednesday from 2:30-3:30pm Pacific time (there is the possibility to change this if the time doesn't work for you).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All the best,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Ruth</div>    </div>

<p>Ruth, I'm not a certified anything with Holacracy, but the organization looks like it's doing important work. I'd love to learn more and see if there might be a fit from a distance...</p>      </div>
