<p>I discussed this matter with a lot of people (do we need management / are managers bad?).&nbsp;</p><p>Discussions I was involved&nbsp;mostly led to the same conclusion: good managers are a good thing, bad managers are a bad thing.</p><p>If you have good people leading the tribe, creating space for everybody and help everyone to do his/her best this provides value and appreciate their work - you want people like this in your organization. It's not about wether management&nbsp;is a good thing - it's about the people filling that role (IMHO)</p>      </div>

<p>Every company needs smart people enough that master the business and skilled enough to sense what are the business needs at all times. They are usually called "Business Leaders". Holacracy is just a tool that don't remove such org. needs. It allows those people - once they get how to use the&nbsp;tool - to serve even in&nbsp;a more efficient way the purpose of the circle/org. by processing all the tensions they are able to sense (the "business needs"). Again Holacracy does not get rid of such skilled people, it don't&nbsp;remove the necessity to have into the company such people; in fact it's just the opposite &amp; it allows also everyone to process any business need they may sense for better expressing the purpose of the Org.</p>      </div>

<p>Totally agree with&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859], great explanation.&nbsp;What we learned now (just a bit short of 1 year with Holacracy) is that in the old structure we hired managers which brought leadership skills (basically these where our business leader).</p><p>Our problem often is that if we try to hire people with leadership skills / business leaders now those are most often full-fletched managers (and they intend to stay in line management positions). So quite often, they are not interested to work for us - the employee market is just not set yet to provide us with skilled business leaders who are not line managers.</p><p>We need more time to learn how to cope with this, but my guess is</p><p>a) we need to start looking for skills rather than position/ titles</p><p>b) start to actively develop needed skills (especially business leaders, I like the term btw) in our current staff</p><p>[@mention:576789226644687408], sorry for hijacking your thread. I understand this is not the core focus of your article. But I think this one of the most crucial points for organisations in transition to adopt Holacracy successfully</p>      </div>

<p>Hi there,</p><p>thanks for your responses I totally agree with you both. Every teams need strong abilities in management and leadership and holacracy&nbsp; is a way to organise a business. My article was simply to put forward a problem that companies may have.&nbsp;</p><p>As [@mention:567217983804388642] said, the more important are skills instead of job title.
