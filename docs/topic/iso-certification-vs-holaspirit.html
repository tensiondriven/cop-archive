<p>Hi Cathy,<br /><br />Are you looking for information on the certifications held by GlassFrog and holaSpirit, or are you looking to achieve ISO certifications, or something else entirely?<br /><br />Matt</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Cathy,</p><p>I was able to gain ISO 9001 certification this year (almost) only showing our Holaspirit governance &amp; tactical records to the auditor. I had only to produce an external document describing all of our processes; this document was built from the accountabilities of our roles in Holaspirit. Hope that helps, Luca</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Cathy</p><p>We managed to re-certify our ISO9001-cerfiticate after one year of pure holacracy-practice. We could even manage to get ISO27001 information security certification which is much harder.</p><p>Also as Luca mentioned showing all the roles, circles and their accountabilites help a lot. For the rest we could show at the audit that people following the defined processes in the management system (as before Holacracy).</p><p>The approach was to take our "old" management-system and forge it to one that was lead by the spirit and rules of Holacracy. We&nbsp;tried not to get into a&nbsp;situation with two "systems" beeing incompatible or worse fighting each other</p><p>So far it went well - although a complete fusion will take years i suppose because the character of the two systems is completely different...</p>      </ul>
