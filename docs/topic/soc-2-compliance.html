  <dd>We are in the process of ensuring that our organization is SOC 2 compliant. We have a Security &amp; Compliance Circle that is charged with handling this. We aren't really having any issues, but we thought it would be good to see if anyone else in the Holacracy community is attempting to become SOC 2 compliant. If so, we'd like to collaborate: please contact me on this thread or via private message.</dd>
