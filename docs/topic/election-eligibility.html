  <dd>Election Eligibility</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi. I'd like to confirm whether an elected rep-link, who has no other defined role in a circle, is eligible for elections in that circle. My interpretation is that an elected rep link is considered a core circle member. So even though they do not have another defined role, they ARE eligible for elections and could therefor be elected rep link of that circle and report to the super circle. Is this correct? Thank you!</dd>

<p>Hello Jen, cristal clear. According to the rules in the Constitution your statement is correct. 2.3.1. states that each elected Rep Link to the Circle becomes a Core Circle Member of that Circle and 2.5.1 states that all Core Circle Members are eligible for election.</p><p>Off course in real life this would be odd. The Rep Link represents the Circle in the Super Circle and needs have to good knowledge of what is happening in this Circle to process Tensions in the Super Circle as well as provide insights on the Metrics. Guess only attending as a Rep Link from the Sub Circle does not bring you these insights. But in the end it is not NVGO and safe enough to try.......&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" /></p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Jen, clarifying question: How did this person got elected in to this role?</p><p>2.5.1 states that "All Core Circle Members are eligible for election...." but as the Person fills no Roles then I am wondering how he/she was part of the Circle.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Tom,&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The person is in the circle because they are the elected rep link from the sub-circle. They are in this circle only as the rep link and have no other defined roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, my question is that since they are in this circle only as a rep link from the circle below, are they eligible for elections?&nbsp;</p><p><br />I hope that clarifies it for you.&nbsp; Thank you <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p>      </ul>
