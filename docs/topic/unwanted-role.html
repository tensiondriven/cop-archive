  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Dear Holacracy Practitioners. We have a role: "the post office" It is all about sending and receiving invoices and other important papers in our company. There was a problem with this role long before Holacracy. Years ago there was an "administration department", but at some point of time, it was dissolved, and the function of administration was divided between many people. One of the function was the post. No one wants to do this. It is time consuming, pretty boring but very important.</dd>
