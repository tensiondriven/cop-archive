  <dd>Hey Mike, I think you may have had a question in the recent Office Hours that I had a thought about. I'm not saying it is a great idea or you should, but if you had something you wanted people to align to, you can include written agreements as attachments in any other membership/employment agreements. If they are too abstract then I'm not sure how powerful it would be, but could be worth experimenting with. Let us know how it goes. :)&nbsp;Hope that helps.&nbsp;</dd>
