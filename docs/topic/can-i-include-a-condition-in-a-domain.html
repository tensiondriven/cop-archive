      <h4>Can I include a condition in a domain ?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi,</p><p>I'd like to setup a domain only under a specific condition. For instance : "Meeting room XXX in case of Disaster Recovery Plan crisis". Is this a&nbsp;good way to do that ? Or should I create a domain "Meeting room XXX" and a policy "Outside Disaster Recovery Plan crisis, the Meeting room XXX is available to anyone"</p>    </div>

<p>The second optiin feels cleaner. It's "this resource is under this role’s control by default; and unless this role requires this resource for fulfilling its accountability regarding X, any other role in the organization may access this resource for its purposes." Thank you for raising this tension and providing options for solution!&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>From my perspective, the first proposal could be clarified such as "In case of Disaster Recovery Plan crisis, meetings will stand in room XXX". Otherwise the policy sounds like an accountability!</p><p>I prefer from far your second proposal. Room XXX becomes clearly a domain, and a policy grant other roles using this room under certain conditions. As I suppose there are some security and reliability issues in the tension behind, this sounds a clear-cut and more consistent option.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Jean-Michel,</p><p>Thanks for your reply, however my first proposal was a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Domain</span>, not a policy.

<p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It depends on your specific tension but if we take a look at the domain definition in the constitution:</p><ul><li><strong>1.1 (b)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Domains”</em></strong>, which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My interpretation would be that it can only be an entire property, not constraint by any specific situation.</p><p>Thus, I would go with your second proposal.</p><p>Does it make sense?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don't think you could delegate the domain + define a policy at the circle level (in governance mtg) saying anyone could use it outside of disaster recovery plan because of section 2.1.3</p><div class="sublevel"><h4>2.1.3 Delegation of Control</h4><p>When a Circle defines a Domain upon one of its Roles, the Circle’s authority to impact, control, and regulate that Domain is instead delegated to that Role and removed from the Circle.</p><p>However, the Circle retains the right to amend or remove that Domain delegation, or to define or modify Policies that further grant or constrain the Role’s authority within the Domain.</p><p>By default, any Domains delegated in this way exclude the authority to dispose of the Domain itself or any significant assets within the Domain, or to transfer those assets outside of the Circle, or to significantly limit any rights of the Circle to the Domain.

<p>Xavier: I think you can go either way, as long as the domain is an activity or process that you want to "exclusively" control; I am not sure if that would be a valid domain as written, as I wonder "what is the activity or property you are looking to control".... one time we had a domain which was something like "pricing for services, except private trainings" or something. I&nbsp;don't know that it would be the "best" solution, though perhaps that is all the clarity you have. And if no one objects, it could serve as a valid domain.</p><p>In either case, the role w/ a domain must create policies or allow others to impact that. So I would try to stay focused on&nbsp;the tension, and if you know what / how you want to constrain something you can try a circle policy to start, or a role domain and let the role figure it out.</p><p>Try not to address all the related tensions, and it can inform if you want a role domain or a circle policy.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes there is no clear answer, and you just need to try something.</p>      </div>

<p>Xavier,</p><p>I think I interpret 2.1.3 the same way you do with regard to a Domain + Policy situation.&nbsp; The key sentence to me is this one:</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;">However, the Circle retains the right to amend or remove that Domain delegation, or to define or modify Policies that further grant or constrain the Role’s authority within the Domain.</p><p>So you can distribute exclusive control over property (a Domain) <em>except</em> as defined by a policy.&nbsp; That usually strikes me as a clean solution to this issue.</p><p>Kevin</p>      </div>
