      <h4>Move Role from Sub Circle to another Sub Circle - how</h4>

<p>I do not see a way to utilize 'restructure sub-circle' to craft this sort of proposal. We did it before in two steps. Is there no way to do it in one step?</p>    </div>

<p>[@mention:454478741268114544]&nbsp;correct this is done in&nbsp;two steps as the restructure will only take into account&nbsp;the roles and policies that are&nbsp;directly part of the parent circle, meaning you will have to first open an agenda item to move out a role from a sub-circle to its parent circle and then open a second agenda item to move&nbsp;that same role into another sub-circle.<br /><br />I have taken note of your request.</p>      </div>

<p>Sally, this was a how question re: the software, and turned out that it is not currently part of the functionalities but is now on the wish list for functionality.</p>      </div>

<p>+1 for this functionality. Now you have to open multiple Governance meetings.</p>      </div>

<p>Surely, the answer to this depends on which role is sensing the tension to move the role from sub circle to sub circle? If the Lead Link of the super circle senses the tension, I can see how this can be done in one governance meeting (two proposals). However, let's say that the role itself senses the tension to be moved, the proposal would need to be brought to the super circle by the Rep Link. In which case, would it be relevant for the Rep Link to then propose the second part of the move to the other sub circle (that they are not rep link of)? If the role itself, senses the tension to be in the other sub circle, my thinking is that their best pathway is to ask the Lead Link of the other sub circle to bring a proposal to create their role and then delete their role from the existing sub circle.
