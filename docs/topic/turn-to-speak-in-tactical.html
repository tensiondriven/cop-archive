      <h4>Turn to speak in Tactical?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>We had an issue come up in our recent tactical meeting. If someone brings a tension and another person has input and is about to speak but the tension-bringer says that they got what they needed, does that mean that the other person doesn't get a chance to speak? Do they bring a new tension (even though it is directly about the tension brought)?</p>    </div>

<p>Jennie,</p><p>Great question! &nbsp;What I generally do in this situation is just how you suggest; &nbsp;bring a new agenda item to follow-up on the previous agenda item brought by another partner. &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes time can be a factor, but usually there will be a chance for your follow-up agenda item/tension to be brought up.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Jennie, as we are focused on the Tension holder and solve one Tension at a time, the answer is Yes. When the Tension holder says "I got what I need" then the agenda item is closed. Off course like Erik states, the other Partner can always add an Agenda item.</p><p>Although the Partner may have input the question remains if this needed information for the Tension holder. That is also why one of the Pathways is Request Information/Help. When this one is named by the Tension holder that is the invite to other Partners to share their idea's or opinion.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>      </div>

<p>Absolutely it must be a separate tension. Otherwise, this sort of thing is an exhibition of shadow power.</p>      </div>
