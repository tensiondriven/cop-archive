<p>Hi Imrane,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Difficult to answer “in theory” without a concrete case but here are some of the answers I can give:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Tension : I don't know who to ask to do this "thing"<br /><ul><li>Proposal we used to accept : Add Acc to Role X to do this "thing"</li><li>How we should handle this :&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">You don't have to handle it. All you can do is ask clarifying questions during that Clarifying Questions step or use your reaction round to express your thoughts</span> <ul><li>Why don't you "do this thing" yourself as long as you respect domains .... ?&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">It sounds like a reaction here. In my reaction round, I may remind&nbsp;the person that she can do it but if she doesn't have the competencies or if it makes sense that another role does it (because we gain some time or because it is more appropriate or...), adding an accountability to that role is the perfect move. Explicit, explicit, explicit.&nbsp;</span></li><li>You want to add an Acc to another Role,&nbsp;have you been granted permission by the Role X to change his role ?&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">You actually don't need the role's permission to propose to add an accountability. If it limits one of your role, than you can propose anything in governance, even if it implies modifying another role.</span></li><li>Don't you want to create a new role instead of modifiying an existing one without permission ?&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">Again, don't need the role's permission. Te person filling the role can always object if it makes sense. Creating a new role vs adding an accountability on an existing one? Well, it really depends if it is obvious that a specific role should do it, I would add it to that role (even if not aligned with the purpose because an accountability doesn't have to be aligned on the purpose, it is another dimension). If not obvious, then let's create a new role and maybe later, we will restructure and merge it with another role but at least we can move forward.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Tension : I have to do "this", but I don't want to.&nbsp; <ul><li>Proposal we used to accept : Add Acc to Role X to do "this"</li><li>How we should handle this : <ul><li>Same as above&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">See my previous answers AND “I don't want to” is not a tension. The person has to give a specific and concrete example of a situation where she was limited in her role(s). If she just doesn't want to do it, she may resign from her role and inform the Lead Link but governance is not about people, it is about roles and the organization.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Tension : I interpret that with your&nbsp;Acc you have to do this. But you said to me that my interpretation is wrong. I want to clarify the gouvernance with or without your approval <ul><li>Proposal we used to accept : Modify Acc on Role X (without permission)</li><li>How we should handle this : same as above&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">Before going to governance, you can also ask the Secretary to give his/her interpretation which will trump all of your interpretation until the next governance meeting. Then, good move to bring it to governance to clarify.</span></li></ul></li><li>Tension :&nbsp;The name of your role is bad, I don't like it <ul><li>Proposal we used to accept : Modify Role X name (without permission)</li><li>How we should handle this :&nbsp; <ul><li>Facilitator should discard this proposal&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">The facilitator can only discard a proposal if it doesn't meet the criterias defined in the constitution. Here as a Facilitator, I may ask during the Clarifying Questions step: “could you give us a concrete situation of your tension?”, “does it limit one of your role?”. If the person fails to answer these questions (i.e. doesn't give an answer or say “no, I don't have a concrete situation” or “no, it doesn't limit one of my role”), I will&nbsp;discard it because she just told me it wasn't a valid proposal based on the constitution's criterias.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Tension : This thing is wrong and is not working <ul><li>Proposal we used to accept : It has to change <ul><li>We accepted it, as it allows us to go through the process until&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Amend &amp; Clarify</strong></li><li>Then, a "new" proposal is made</li><li>Should the facilitator test proposal here all the time ? Or at the begining ? &nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">Testing the validity of the proposal is actually to test if the tension is valid to be processed, not the result. For the result, the facilitator can always raise NVGO objection because it wouldn't be a valid result to be processed in the governance meeting. For testing the validity of the proposal, the facilitator (or anyone) doesn't have to wait for the amend &amp; clarify step, anyone can ask questions during the Clarifying Questions step.</span></li><li>I guess, with all cases listes above, the right place to test&nbsp;proposals is in&nbsp;<strong>Amend &amp; Clarify&nbsp;<span style="color: #8064a2;">Nop, would be infringing the process and the Facilitator can't do that</span></strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">I hope it gives you some keys&nbsp;to understand in more depth this part of the process. It is tricky though so if you don't understand it all, it is normal.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Please feel free to ask more questions and the more you are specific about the case, the easier it will be for us as coach to help you. There are so many scenarios in Holacracy and you never really know. The facilitator has to be neutral and not judge nor discard a proposal just because he mentally think it is not valid.</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">I am curious: did you attend the practitioner training or coach training? We dive in more depth during the coach training.</span></p>      </div>

<p>Capturing a tension and associated desire in that format forces getting some more clarity, which can be useful. That said,&nbsp;I usually wouldn't&nbsp;recommend it&nbsp;for new practitioners - it's more than is needed and I'd worry it would&nbsp;contribute to triggering Holacracy overwhelm. &nbsp;But I think it's a great&nbsp;tool for some people at certain&nbsp;points in their Holacracy journey, or when you want to convey the tension more effectively to others...</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Imrane,<br /><br />Hard to give you an answer case by case.<br /><br />Mainly, just keep in mind a few milestones,<br />• Be sure that the tension is grounded in day to day activity of the organization<br />• Try to express the tension trough this user story format:<br />"As &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal/desire&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;."<br />• Ask for a tension driven starting&nbsp; proposal, even weird<br />• Rely in the governance process as a "grinder"</p><p>Perhaps could you attend to the <a href="/event/coach-office-hours" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next coach office hours</a> session.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Imrane,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the Coach Training, depends if you want it in french. If so, I am the one organizing it and I will definitely schedule it soon. The pre requisite is to attend a Practitioner Training though... We cover a lot of the basics during that training as your colleague may have told you.</p><p>Re your question, I will give you the wording in french since it seems like your native language:&nbsp;<a href="https://igipartners.com/constitution-holacracy#art323" target="_blank">https://igipartners.com/constitution-holacracy#art323</a> (for english speakers:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art323" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art323" target="_blank">https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art323</a></a>)</p><p>“<strong>3.2.3 Tester les Propositions</strong></p><p>Le Facilitateur peut tester la validité d’une Proposition en posant des questions au Proposeur. Pour que la Proposition passe le test, le Proposeur doit être en mesure de décrire la Tension et de donner un exemple de situation réelle, actuelle ou passée, dans laquelle la Proposition aurait déjà permis de réduire cette Tension et d’aider le Cercle de l’une des manières autorisées par la section précédente. Le Facilitateur doit abandonner la Proposition s’il estime que le Proposeur n’a pas rempli ces conditions.</p><p>Toutefois, pour évaluer la validité d’une Proposition, le Facilitateur peut seulement juger si le Proposeur a présenté l’exemple et les explications qui sont requis, et si ceux-ci ont été présentés selon un raisonnement logique et sont donc raisonnables. Le Facilitateur ne peut pas porter de jugement quant à leur exactitude, ni juger si la Proposition est susceptible de traiter la Tension.”</p><p>It is not written when the Facilitator can do that but since he cannot infringe the process, just like anyone, the obvious step to do it is during Clarifying Questions. During that step, I may, as a Facilitator, ask questions (like anyone) like: “could you remind us your tension underline this proposal?”, or “which role is limited by the tension you are feeling?”. If, given the answers, it is clear that the tension doesn't limit one of the person's role, I would ask: “did you get permission from the role who is limited by this tension&nbsp;to process it?” (here we are not talking about the role stated in the proposal but the role who should feel the tension because if you are allowed to process a tension for the sake of another role because he gave you the permission to, it is ok). If, that person is not authorized or doesn't have a concrete situation, it is a “mental” tension, based on speculation or nothing, just a good idea, than I have the clue that it doesn't respect the constitution's criteria of a valid tension to be processed in a governance meeting and I can drop the item directly. As a Coach, I will also give a bit of explanations here, this is why it is crucial to get support from a Coach, otherwise people will feel like the Facilitator can drop any proposal when he wishes to.</p><p>Again, as a Facilitator, you have to be neutral and seek for an argument without judging it. If the person says: “yes it does limit my role X”, you can't judge whether it is true or not,&nbsp;all you can ask is: “ok, what specifically? the purpose? which accountability?”. You are a curious scientist trying to help the person figure out whether it is a valid tension to be processed or not.</p>      </div>

      <div class="post-content">
<p>And also, one thing: at the beginning, as a Coach, I would not test the proposals, just because Holacracy is hard enough and the governance process is already very complex so if a person brings a tension, I don't want to stop her directly and get her frustrated with the process. If she brings a change, it is already great and before, in previous versions of the Constitution, this paragraph didn't even exist, we couldn't test the proposals.</p><p>It is very useful though if you have a some&nbsp;people with great mental ideas coming from their background but not grounded on the company's reality, to prevent them from spoiling your governance records with “might happen” kind of stuff.</p><p>The goal is not to prevent tensions from being processed, but rather to put clarity on the fact that it is based on a reality, a concrete situation (a tension is a gap between what IS and what could be) and that it does limit the organization because the person is sensing it in her roles and she works in it on a day-to-day basis.
