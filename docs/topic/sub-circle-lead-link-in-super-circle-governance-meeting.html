  <dd>Sub-circle Lead link in super-circle governance meeting</dd>

  <dd>Is the Lead link of a sub-circle automatically a Core Member of the super-circle? ie. can he attend Governance meetings of the super-circle? From what i remember from the Practitioner course the answer is yes. But reading the Constitution&nbsp;confuses me: (a)  each Partner filling a Defined Role in the Circle; (b)  the Lead Link of the Circle, as defined in Section 2.2 ; (c)  each Rep Link elected to the Circle, as defined in Section 2.6.4 ; (d)  and each Cross Link into the Circle, as...</dd>

<p><em>Is the Lead link of a sub-circle automatically a Core Member of the super-circle? ie. can he attend Governance meetings of the super-circle?</em></p><p>The answer is yes because from the Super-Circle perspective, the Lead Link is just a role (which happens to be a Sub-Circle and thus, the person filling that role becomes Lead Link). So it works just as a role: “<strong>(a)</strong> each Partner filling a Defined Role in the Circle;”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>      </ul>

<p>It&nbsp;is true that as it is formulated in the Constitution it&nbsp;does lead to confusion (2.3.1).&nbsp;In my organisation a Rep Link,&nbsp;who did not go to the course but who has studied in detail the Constitution, is pretty much convinced that we are doing an error inviting the Lead Link of the same circle into the Super Circle. Maybe it is worth to make it explicit?</p>      </ul>

<p>I'd be interested in your secretary's interpretation. My take is that the human filling the lead link in the subcircle is assigned from the supercircle and only because she already fills a role in the supercircle... But it seems your question is more nuanced. Do I understand you to be asking whether the lead link is still a member of the supercircle? If so, the logic diagrams I've seen from [@mention:449693036223847456]Robertson's book make it clear to me that the lead link represents the interests of the supercircle to the subcircle because it is part of the supercircle and subcircle.... If that's not your question, I'd love clarity so that I can explore this with greater relevance to your question.</p>      </ul>

<p>I would very much support clarifying this in the constitution. &nbsp;</p><p>I know that H1's position seems to be that the LeadLink is included as a member of the supercircle, but I don't believe this is at all clear in the text of the constitution, and this has led to&nbsp;confusion in my organization.</p>      </ul>

<p>I was at a practitioneer training about a month ago, and specifically asked Brian about this and confusion this introduces.</p><p>He seemed to be okay with clarifying it in 5.0 constitution.</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks Jeff, my question was just related to a discrepancy between what I have seen in the course and what it can been understood from the Constitution.&nbsp;I think I am done with this. Thanks a lot!</p>      </ul>
