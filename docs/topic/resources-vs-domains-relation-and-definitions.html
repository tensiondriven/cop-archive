      <h4>RESOURCES vs. DOMAINS - relation and definitions</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>RESOURCES vs. DOMAINS - for me the difference is still vague, even after reading all discussions tagged with "resource" on the forum:<br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3yaTm" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3yaTm</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2oxQ7Ob" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2oxQ7Ob</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3GDpH" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3GDpH</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3ERVA" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3ERVA</a></p><p><br />So, can anyone specifically answer the following questions:<br /><strong>1. What is the relation between resources and domains?</strong> (are the same?, are different and if so, how to clearly differentiate them? Maybe resources&gt;domains or maybe otherwise?)<br /><strong>2. What are examples of resources LeadLink can independently allocate? If possible, please name 10 examples of such resources</strong> (e.g. time, money – or maybe they are already wrong?)</p>    </div>

<p>Domain is property&nbsp;or a thing like Andrew says and as well in&nbsp; Article: 1.1</p><ul><li><strong>(b)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Domains”</em></strong>, which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization.</li></ul><p>In Holacracy people are not things, nor a resource. A partner is someone who is available to be assigned to a role. Resources are usually money so I will leave it at that for now. Resources could presumably be other things, so I do get the question; if money is a thing then indeed it could also be a domain, or controlled by a domain (fence).</p><p>I am hoping to help clarify both the constitution and the teaching of this going forward. It is a common source of ambiguity.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:553141978014385339]&nbsp;in the <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art11" target="_blank">Constitution&nbsp;</a>article 1.1(b) the definition of the Domain is about "things". If you replace "things" with "resource" then you have the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>The Domain is the "fence" around any resource of the Organization which is exclusively control by a Role or a Circle. As long as the control is not delegated then is a "Resource" which can be impacted or controlled by anyone as long as is not forbidden by the Constitution or a Policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is more clearer now?</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks to both of you :-) Just to check I'll try to&nbsp;answer the original question myself. <strong>Please confirm/change/add sth.</strong></p><p><strong>1. What is the relation between resources and domains?</strong> (are the same?, are different and if so, how to clearly differentiate them? Maybe resources&gt;domains or maybe otherwise?)</p><p><em>There is no logic relation (=, &lt;, &gt; etc.) between RESOUCES and DOMAINS, as they&nbsp;belong to different categories.<br /> RESOURCES=THINGS (it can be a car, computer, www website, database, file, production machine etc.)<br />DOMAIN=PROPERTY or FENCE (such fence can be built around barely anything, including RESOURCES, but also other intangible beings&nbsp;like for example "processes" or &nbsp;"communication with a specific client")&nbsp;</em></p>      </div>
