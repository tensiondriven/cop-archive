I am a business trainer with many years of experience in trainings in interpersonal communication, negotiation skills, sales and building effective teams. I am writing to you to verify with you what I have learned about Holacracy and to ask your advice and clarifications so that I can understand it better and present it to others.

<p>Thanks for posting, Mike. I believe you address some very core issues affecting the decision to implement Holacracy or not. I have also been on a journey of investigation with Holacracy over the past year, and I concur that there is no substitute for training and experience ...particularly experience within the relevant culture. If you'd like to understand more about my views, you could read the article I just wrote.&nbsp;<a href="http://spaxman.com.hk/news-events/should-your-organization-invest-in-self-management/" target="_blank">http://spaxman.com.hk/news-eve...-in-self-management/</a>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Ewa Bocian, the Holacracy coach you guys recommended to me, asked me about my impressions of being on the Holacracy forum. I said I felt like an ant watching an elephant's trunk swinging above it in a friendly and caring way. In an hour long phone talk Ewa put me on the right track. I got my answer to the question I asked the Holacracy community. Thank you so much. Special thanks to Ewa and Matt in particular.</p>      </ul>
