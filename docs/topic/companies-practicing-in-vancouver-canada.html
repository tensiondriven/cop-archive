  <dd>Companies practicing in Vancouver, Canada</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi all - does anyone out there know of any companies in Vancouver that are or were practicing Holacracy? Our company uses a lot of holacratic processes, but does practice it in a complete way, but we are interested in talking to some locals who have taken the leap. Cheers, Josh</dd>

<p>Hi Josh, Our company (PlasticBank.org) is based in Vancouver and I am about to embark on the Facilitator Training in New York April 16-20. Presumably we will be able to implement it with that training. Happy to stay connected on this journey.</p>      </ul>
