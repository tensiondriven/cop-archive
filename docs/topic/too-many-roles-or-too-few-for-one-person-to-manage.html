      <h4>Too many roles or too few for one person to manage</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi folks. &nbsp;Am interested in how other people are managing a situation of how the number of roles is managed and controlled, for both feasibility and legality please.</p><p>There are two potential scenarios:</p><p>1, When someone is under-deployed because in effect they do not have enough roles to fill their time. I understand a Lead can allocate a role to them, but what if realistically they can't perform that role because they are not interested or lack the expertise? From an employment legislation point of view, are you starting to change their contract of employment and rights, or even make them redundant, because there aren't enough suitable roles available?</p><p>2. And the other scenario is the opposite, when someone has more roles than they can feasibly manage. &nbsp;I guess this can be raised as a tension and provide the evidence to find more resource to fill a role. &nbsp;But what if they say they can manage it, and want the extra compensation to go with, but legally it is not good practice&nbsp;from a wellbeing point of view to ask someone to take on so much responsibility?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do companies talk about Full Time Equivalents in roles?</p><p>Do people have a system for calculating / monitoring how utilised Partners are?</p><p>How have people married up employment legislation (contracts of employment) with Partner's flexing role accountabilities?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many thanks</p><p>Julia</p>    </div>

<p>Great questions. I wish we were at a point past all those questions so that I could give you concrete answers.&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing I can add is that we are stealing a page from another company practicing Holacracy and intend to identify fractional FTEs to roles. The tension that we're trying to address is budgetary, aligning funding sources to activities, and ensuring that role of lesser value or importance don't have more attention than roles of greater value/need/importance. For example: role A is only budgeted for 0.10 FTE and role B is budgeted for 2.5 FTE. People would then have a role and FTE equivalence calculation. We're prototyping this in excel at the moment but still a bit a way from having a running system that I can smile about.</p><p>Hopefully this concept helps give you ideas.</p>      </div>

<p>HolacracyOne has a system called Attention Point System.&nbsp;<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/3628" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/3628</a>&nbsp;</p><p>My organization Purely Poultry basically copied the Attention Point system. In our policy instead of 100 Attention Points equals a "full-focus partner" we say that 40 "Role Hours" equals a "full focus partner". We have a team member who works 15 hours a week. She has 5 roles. One role is allocated 1 role hour, another 5, another 3, another 2 and another role 2. &nbsp;We use a google sheet where these role hours are allocated.</p>      </div>

<p>I do believe that employment law in the UK versus United States are significantly different so I am not able to comment about legality in the UK.</p><p>Sometimes unfortunately we do have to assign roles to people who are not interested or who do not have the expertise. If we did not assign roles to people who were not interested or have the expertise my organization would have 1) never started and 2) would not be able to continue to operate. We did adopt a "Required Role" policy that basically states that if you were hired to be a Customer Service Representative or other role 1) the lead link can't remove that role from you easily and 2) you can't just easily say no I don't want to be a Customer Service Rep any more.</p><p>Purely Poultrys 1.15. Required Role Policy<br />The roles that a Team Member was hired to fill at initial employment when they joined the Purely Poultry team is henceforward called a “Required Role”.<br />If a Team Member resigns from a Required Role, that resignation constitutes voluntary resignation from all roles currently filled. This means that Team Member is offering a voluntary termination from Purely Poultry in general.<br />Required Roles can be removed only if a majority of Team Diplomats vote in favor of removing a required role from a team member,<br />Whoever has the authority to assigning, removing, or re-assigning Roles to other Team Members, cannot remove a Team Member from their Required Role.<br />Whoever has the authority to fire any Team Member, retains the authority to fire any Team Member.</p><p>We do not compensate based on how many full time equivalents or Role Hours a person is filling. We compensate based on a per hour basis.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>It would be impossible to prove that an accountability must be done by a specific role. Accountabilities could always be done by a new or different role. We have Required Roles but we do not have the ability to dictate what accountabilities the roles have outside of proposing valid governance tensions or valid governance objections. To find a new role filler does not have to mean that you have to add staff. A role can be filled by 30 seconds a week if the role filler deems that 30 seconds is enough to fill the accountabilities to their satisfaction. If no role fillers volunteer and all partners reject the assignment of the role then the role would be filled by the Lead Link because "The Lead Link also holds all un-delegated Circle-level Domains and Accountabilities."</p>      </div>

<p>Does this mean that a Required Role filler has a de facto "veto" right to refuse a new or modified accountability, even if the Role description is the most obviously suitable Purpose for the added accountability ?</p><p>Let me give more background. We have a Production circle, in which there is a Stock Manager role (which buys stuff from suppliers) and a Machine Builder role, which uses stuff from the Stock to build products. That worked so far, but then we began using a software product, which requires a serial&nbsp;key to be provisioned from the software supplier. The Machine Builder role needed a serial key and wasn't sure who to ask it from, and while an informal process was currently in place, a discussion occured on who was supposed to provide that serial key (and hence provisioning it). Our intuition would be to solve the&nbsp;tension "There is no existing process to provision a serial key" by extending the "Stock Manager" role accountability "Provision hardware components from suppliers" to&nbsp;"Provision hardware and software from suppliers". However, the "Stock Manager"&nbsp;objected that it was software, not hardware, and that he had no time to process that new item on top of all other accountabilities he also had.</p><p>How would you takle that use case ?</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks Flavio, it does make a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>I do agree, but in practice, let's say this is a really tedious task that no one really wants to achieve, and that has no way around it (no clever shortcut) -- something as simple&nbsp;as sorting mail for instance (imagine a company having lots of mail).</p><p>In that case, The Role filler believes he needs to outsource it, and creates a circle "Mail", in which he would like to create a few roles to split the task ; he calls for help, but no-one comes. What then ? He follows the Strategy to split his attention between the most important tasks and this new tedious task that is nevertheless necessary ?

<p>Florent,</p><p>Great question. Likewise is a private, nonprofit college that serves the needs of indigent prison inmates. Our model requires a large number of volunteers who help faculty and staff handle the various emerging needs. So, our first line of defense against undesirable tasks remaining undone relies on the servant leader disposition of volunteers.</p><p>Likewise cultivates 4 volunteer channels (from Luke 10:25–37's "love the Lord your God will all your heart, soul, strength, and mind"). The "strength" group invites "non-academic" talent contribution (e.g.-transcription services, since our students cannot access computers and must submit handwritten assignments). Faculty may volunteer to fulfill this need. When they do, they earn "development points" (from developing their volunteer/non-direct-compensation disposition). These development points increase the faculty members' next contract according to formula (up to doubling regular direct compensation). Likewise sets aside the development funds whether faculty determines to increase their value to the organization or not. Of course, if faculty members fail to handle the opportunity to their benefit; and volunteers fail to materialize; then the service falls within general staffing expenses — which keeps the saved funds from being applied into the general faculty support endowment (since staffing needs for the activity consume resources). We&nbsp;recognized the need for exact transcriptions during the prototyping of 'TR-1000: The Books of Luke' and placed the need into the existing budget process so that either "strengths" volunteers (or faculty acting as volunteers for future benefit) or staff might fulfill that need.</p><p>To summarize using this example, if faculty wants to voluntarily fulfill transcription needs, they thereby increase their future value to the organization while helping to control staffing expenses. Otherwise, other volunteers usually step in and handle the 'unwanted' activity. If an undesirable and essential activity falls through these cracks, then I raise the tension to the staff circle's governance meeting and we adjust (preferred) or create (last resort) a role and its compensation to cover the unfulfilled non-academic task. However, this is a last resort as it removes an opportunity for faculty development.</p><p>One final thought, if an activity is truly unnecessary, then why are we doing it? More likely, we need to show how the activity connects to the overall mission. Partners who value the mission ought to understand the value of every necessary activity and that their commitment to the mission naturally requires an interest in activities even as mundane as checking the mail. Can they imagine fulfilling the organization's mission without an awareness of whatever might be sitting in the mailbox!!??!! So, unless your example is purely hypothetical (and even if it is), an emphasis on connecting even the most mundane acts to the mission needs to happen--and regularly. If it's work that's essential to the organization's purpose, then figure out how to elevate the work's importance. If no one in the organization values the service that the work does to the organization, maybe it's time to hire someone who will value the organization through the work...</p>      </div>

<p>Hello Florent,</p><p>I see your point, and I do understand that in every company there´s a lot of unwanted work that has to be done.

<p>@Karilen, somewhere I. The leadership literature from the past 25 years is a story re. a cleaning lady who scolded the company president for walking past an easy to address mess. The president was not offended since the corporate culture held that anyone and everyone held responsibility for the image and safety of the organization. Thus, "taking out the trash" did not need to be assigned to any single person since everyone naturally held that accountability. Is this along the lines of what you're sensing?</p>      </div>
