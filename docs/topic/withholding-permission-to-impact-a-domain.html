      <h4>Withholding permission to impact a domain</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>In the article 4.1.2c of the constitution (v4.1) it is explained that a role holding a domain must allow&nbsp;access to the domain upon request, if the role sees&nbsp;no objection.</p><p>The constitution doesn't specify what could by defined as an objection in those cases, but my guts tell me&nbsp;that those objections need to be tested on their validity, exactly like in a governance meeting. I have experienced situation where objections are needlessly predictive or&nbsp;the objection is already a problem and would not be caused by granting access.&nbsp;Withholding permission in such&nbsp;cases doesn't seem healthy.</p><p>Very simple example - The omnipresent Website domain:</p><p>Role Communication&nbsp;hast control over the domain: Website content. Role Outreach would like to add content to the website to market a new service. Role Communication&nbsp;objects, due to the fact that the website is overloaded and also a new website will be launched soon (no time estimate) and the new content rather needs to be added there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Tiziano,</p><p>From my perspective, objection - as it is described - seams non valid as:<br /> • it is already an issue<br /> • sounds like a resource allocation matter…</p><p>Actually, might be here 2 tensions at the same time:<br /> • Role Outreach: adding content,<br /> •&nbsp;Role Communication: mastering an overloaded website<br /> to be solved by 2 different proposals</p><p>What about?<br /> Hope that helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Tiziano,</p><p>I underline the points you are making (about invalidity), but have not quite got your&nbsp;underlying question in the starting post (nor can find any in your post ;-).</p><p>I can see different questions, such as: 1) what is the technically correct way/answer re objections in case of access request?&nbsp;2) what do I do as (what role?) if someone is not willing to grant access even if the objections are not valid? 3) or: what to do when ego-driven behavior shows up and people don't play by the rules or try to outsmart the system by stubbornly staying with their perspective only.</p><p>If it is about further pathways to process that, you are not dependent on the valid/invalid objection question.</p><p>1) Outreach&nbsp;could think of using governance to withdraw the domain from that role, if outreach could provide real examples how this harms the circle. You could&nbsp;make it part of the circle and add a policy how access is constrained for example to integrate possibly occuring objections of communication role.&nbsp;</p><p>2) additionally, probably not the preferred option but still a pathway:&nbsp;if a role-filler continuously shows stubborn behavior pitch the lead link to check role-fit. If it is about people fighting the rules of the game a more in-depth coaching or conversation seems&nbsp;also helpful&nbsp;IMHO (by whatever role holds accountabilities for that).&nbsp;</p><p>Curious, what specifically is of interest to you.</p><p>- Gerald</p>      </div>

<p>Jean-Michel: &nbsp;Sounds like it might fail the "already an issue" test, but there is no required objection criteria that says it can't be about a resource allocation matter, so that part might be perfectly valid...</p>      </div>

<p>Even if it would be a resource allocation matter, in my opinion it wouldn't be a valid objection either, since it's then a matter of prioritization. The Role Communication would have the duty to capture the&nbsp;request and transparently&nbsp;communicate&nbsp;the priorities.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Tiziano,</p><blockquote><p>I agree, but it's not something that is constitutionally requested if I understand it correctly, as objection testing seems only to be restricted to governance meetings.</p></blockquote><p>right, that's my understanding as well.</p><p>See Constitution 3.2.5 "Testing objections":&nbsp;"The Facilitator MAY&nbsp;test the validity of a claimed Objection by asking the Objector questions"...unless it is required by a circle member: (3.2.6. "The Facilitator MUST&nbsp;test an Objection if requested by any Core Circle Member").</p><p>However, interesting point you brought up about integrating it into the constitution. It is not specified IMO how that objection testing&nbsp;works outside meetings and if it is (always) the Circle Facilitator testing (and which one in case of different circles...). Interesting point...some additional clarity might help indeed.</p><p>- Gerald</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Gerald, right, I kind of missed to formulate a clear question <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>Are objections on domain impact requests to be tested? How? By whom? If not, why not?</p><p>I&nbsp;think&nbsp;having a process to rely on when requesting&nbsp;to impact a domain can feel empowering for the requesting side and relieving for the domain holder.</p><p>I don't feel like assuming that when a&nbsp;domain-controlling role-filler denies access to the domain, it necessarily&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be solved by either removing the domain or replacing the role-filler. I fear this encourages ego-driven behaviours.</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Tiziano,</p><p>in&nbsp;my understanding: I'd always use the objection testing criteria if a phrase in the constitution, a policy or accountability refers to the term objection. e.g. as well&nbsp;if an accountability states "doing X after integrating objections&nbsp;of role Y"</p><p>- Gerald</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I agree, but it's not something that is constitutionally requested if I understand it correctly, as objection testing seems only to be restricted to governance meetings.</p><p>Now I can&nbsp;of course make governance proposals to extend objection testings to other situations&nbsp;in our company.</p><p>The question is: would&nbsp;it make sense to be&nbsp;constitutionally requested? At least for domain impact objections, as this is the only mention of "objections" outside governance in the constitution.</p>      </div>
