  <dd>HOW CAN HOLACRACY APPLY TO THE MAKING AND VIEWING OF ART?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello I am an artist currently studying a MA at the Slade School of Fine Art (UCL). I am interested in holacracy in my research and was wondering if anyone who had experience or greater understanding of holacracy could advice me on how I can apply it to the making and viewing of my art work. I would really appreciate any help you could give me so please contact me for more information or if you think you could help. I look forward to hearing from you! Naomi www.naomifitzsimmons.com</dd>
