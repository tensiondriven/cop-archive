      <h4>Tension brought to Tactical vs. Collaboration</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>What is a good thinking process to determine whether to attempt to collaborate with other roles to get something done outside of the meeting structure, or to bring the thing-that-needs-doing as a tension to a tactical meeting?</p><p>Is there a rule of thumb to help one determine which route works better in holacracy?</p><p>The scenario I'm working with involves a process by which a role (Role#1) communicates with potential customers and the tools with which that role does the communicating. Role#1 has the authority to do the communicating and to design its own process. The process Role#1 thinks&nbsp;would work best, however, involves the purpose of Role#2, and deploying the tools needed by the process requires Role#3.</p>    </div>
