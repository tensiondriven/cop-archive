      <h4>How do sub-circles "talk" to each other</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello Holacracy Hivemind!</p><p>We are in an exciting time where our Main Circle has split into Dev, Rev Ops&nbsp;and Customer Happiness. We understand the function and accountabilities of the Rep Link for these new sub-circles to the main circle. What we can't figure out is how these 3 sub-circles&nbsp;communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Do we create a policy to invite and/or request them to be present at tactical and governance meetings of the other subcircles?&nbsp;</p><p>What are our next steps?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Morgan</p>    </div>

<p>One way they could communicate is via coming together at the Main Circle to co-ordinate with each other. You can also use Cross-Links.</p><p>I'm curious about what the tension was that lead to the separation into three circles?</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Morgan,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next to the constitutionally required meetings of Tactical + Governance you can have any kind of other meetings that you find will move the organization forward (or meetings just for fun). Is there e.g. a certain value chain across circles in the org, then you could e.g. come up with a special meeting to sync the different roles or just call in a focus meeting with roles from different circles if it's necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the detailed tension behind the need that the 3 circles need to talk?<br /><br />Best,<br />Max</p>      </div>

<p>&gt;&nbsp;constitutionally required meetings of Tactical + Governance<br /><br />By the way, as far as i understand this — Tactical is not _required_, the Constitution just sets the example you can implement, but explicitly lets you to change it, or remove at all (that's changing too). <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>
