  <dd>Projects Assigned to all Role Fillers?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Recently tactical meetings have started allowing you to assign projects and tensions to multiple people. Is this intentional, if so curious about the thought there? Or perhaps it's a bug. I'm noticing a new bad habit in our meeting outputs as a result. Jenn</dd>

<p>[@mention:449833773730792463]&nbsp;I find helpful the evolution you propose : "Each" instead of "all" express better the idea.</p>      </ul>

<p>Being able to assign tensions to multiple people is a bug...&nbsp; Thanks for pointing that out.&nbsp; We'll get it taken care of.</p><p>Being able to assign projects to multiple people is on purpose, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of when you would use that would be (for instance)&nbsp;in the case of a new strategy,&nbsp;when you want to request that all circle members take a project to break down the strategy.&nbsp; Does that make sense?</p><p>I'm curious about the bad habit.&nbsp; Is it related to the tensions or the projects?</p><p>(Heather&nbsp;@&nbsp;GlassFrog)</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:449833773730792463]&nbsp;Yes love the each and love the distinction! Going to share those words as a part of coaching the team on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Heather,</p><p>I can coach the team with the habit if that is intentional, in my experience assigning a project to everyone in the role leads to confusion. I can see where it might be useful but this is more like a 'We can all work on an updated xyz." which just means no one is going to update it. I will coach the team on when it would be helpful to assign a project to multiple people and when it wouldn't. Thanks for the clarifications.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenn</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:493184366878843164]: it might be helpful to note that when you choose "All Role Fillers" or "All Circle Members", it is creating a separate project for each person in that role, not assigning everyone to one project. Each person is expected to report out on their own project. The use case would be if you wanted each circle member to take on a project to for something like "Personal system audited" or "New strategy broken down into projects for roles I fill" or if you need each person in a role to take on a project pertaining to to that role. A single project can't be assigned to multiple people, and I agree that&nbsp;if they could, they&nbsp;could easily&nbsp;devolve into "we should do this".&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the first time I've heard that there was confusion about this - your instinct is good, but apparently&nbsp;there's a failure in the UI. Do you think that if we changed the label in the dropdown to be "Each circle member" and "Each role filler", it would&nbsp;be&nbsp;clearer to you and your team?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
