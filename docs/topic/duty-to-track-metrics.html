      <h4>Duty to track metrics</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>Constitution says everyone must track and report on the metrics assigned to their roles. What happens if tracking some metric requires to do a lot of work? Does&nbsp;the person having that role&nbsp;has to prioritise it over&nbsp;normal&nbsp;tasks? Or is it their own decision based on their best judgement?</p>    </div>

<p>In our experience, metrics are picked from something that's quite easy to collect. If the effort of collecting metrics requires a lot of work, it becomes something that's ongoing and I think should be "promoted" to be an accountability. And after doing so, we can treat collecting metrics as project and judge its relative priority among other project / action.</p>      </div>

<p>Great question&nbsp;[@mention:471649920894755840].&nbsp; I would be curious to hear what others say.&nbsp; Our standard coaching is that it should be prioritized like any other work (meaning that perhaps the metrics won't get updated in a timely fashion).</p><p>More interesting to me is that Rep Links have this accountability:&nbsp; "Providing visibility to the Super-Circle into the health of the Sub-Circle, <em>including reporting on any metrics</em> or checklist items assigned to the whole Sub-Circle".&nbsp; However, my understanding is that Rep Links can't accept work on behalf of the Circle, so how can a Rep Link accept the work associated with reporting on a metric?</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:549059653907130620],&nbsp;I&nbsp;guess it's similar to how metrics are assigned to roles.&nbsp;It's something that lead-link assigns,&nbsp;not something that circle accepts. In that sense metrics and checklists are not the same as projects and actions.</p>      </div>

<p>The short answer is, a metric can't require a lot of extra work (or it should be turned down).&nbsp;</p><p>The key distinction is, "Does reporting on this metric (as defined) place an additional expectation on my role?" In other words, you can't sneak in work by making it a metric (you have to propose governance to do that).&nbsp;</p><p>So, as long as the role-filler <em>already</em> has access to the information in the course of energizing their&nbsp;work (and there may be some negotiation between the Lead Link and the role-filler on how the metric is defined), then they should report on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I think this answers&nbsp;[@mention:549059653907130620]&nbsp;question about Rep Link as well. Rep Link is only reporting, not taking additional work.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:471649920894755840]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:455886150941203371]&nbsp;for getting back to this topic.&nbsp; Looking at it now, it seems obvious; but this helped clarify quite a bit.&nbsp; The Accountability on the Rep Link is clearly "reporting on any metrics", not generating the metrics assigned to the Circle.</p>      </div>
