  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Here a set of roles to pick and choose from to gain speed in anchoring the emerging Holacracy practices. Typically relevant after the initial months of a Holacracy implementation. These roles together with the Holacracy implementation roles App posted by [@mention:449411339497350002] could also act as a Holacracy implementation circle. These are intended as examples. I have picked them from different implementations to show the diversity of roles that can support an emerging Holacracy...</dd>

<p>This is great - love the storyteller role from an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">internal</span> marketing perspective, also.</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:476716727643924128]&nbsp;great suggestion. Thanks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>sounds like an evolution to split internal marketing/comma from external evangelist as a role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The evangelist is a great way to boost ownership over the Holacracy process and put spotlight on role models. Just having someone external to your circle and new to Holacracy visit you become more conscious about what you do and continue to be asked to explain the why behind the process &nbsp;</p><p>The evangelist could be accountable for:</p><p>- blogging externally about our Holacracy practice</p><p>- inviting externals to observe our Holacracy practice at circles in our organization (that at least got score xyz on the Holacracy competency assessment)</p><p>- hosting externals during observation sessions</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:456449141667144364], it's a great list of options for organizations new to this!&nbsp;</p><p>I noted a few points for improvement:</p><ul><li>Organization Steward <ul><li>The accountability "<em>Having a picture of where the organization stands currently based on input from the whole organization</em>" doesn't qualify as an accountability in my interpretation (i.e. NVGO), because it's an outcome (vs. an activity). Maybe it'd be best captured in the purpose, or you may want to specify a more concrete activity. Or just remove it, as&nbsp;it's probably necessary for doing the 2nd accountability anyway.</li><li>The accountability "<span><em>Translating organizational ideas to practical and working proposals and supporting others in these efforts</em>", due to how it's framed, could easily lead to proposals designed from mind vs. tensions. I think it's especially risky for new practitioners. I suggest replace 'ideas' by 'tensions'.</span></li></ul></li></ul>      </ul>

<p>thanks&nbsp;[@mention:449411339497350002]! Lets integrate your points&nbsp;</p><p>- change&nbsp;<em>having</em> to&nbsp;<em>presenting</em> -&nbsp;to make it something you expect on an ongoing basis from this role -&nbsp;as context - it was introduced when there was confusion on where we stand&nbsp;and were going with Holacracy maturity - and this accountability took care of&nbsp;<em>presenting&nbsp;</em>a starting point any time there were tensions on where to go next and prioritize that properly within the Holacracy Implementation circle.</p><p>-&nbsp;<em>ideas&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>tensions</em> - like it.&nbsp;</p><p>I have edited these in the original post.</p>      </ul>
