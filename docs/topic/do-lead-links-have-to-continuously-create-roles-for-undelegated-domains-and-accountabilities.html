  <dd>Do Lead Links have to continuously create roles for undelegated domains and accountabilities ?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, all: The Lead Link acts as the role that handles everything that has not been delegated to any role within the circle. For the sake of clarity, does the Lead Link have to continuously define new role every time he/she identifies another undelegated domain/accountability ? Or can it stay undelegated forever until someone has a tension about it ? Thanks, &nbsp; Dien. &nbsp;</dd>

<p>Hi Dien,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different elements here: accountabilities &amp; domains.</p><p>1/ Accountabilities: yes, it is the Lead Link's duty to differentiate it into one or more role (by creating a new role or adding it to an existing role). Until the governance meeting (or gov out of gov proposal) comes up, it is the Lead Link who fills that accountability. A good Lead Link would definitely not work and differentiate it in governance ASAP.</p><p>2/ Domains: a domain on the circle doesn't have to be broken down into one or more role. It can stay as the “family property” until some tensions arise and you need to put more clarity by delegating part of the domain on a role for example or by defining a policy in the governance of the circle. In this scenario, it would no longer be the family property.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Dien,</p><p>Yes is Yes to your first question <strong>"Does that sound about right ?"</strong></p><p>Re your second question <strong>"I'm also curious where this is mentioned in the constitution.

<p>Hi, Margaux:</p><p>Thanks for the clarification.</p><p>So, in practice, let's say, something needs to get done and there is no role yet to do this, and no one else has tensions about this, then the Lead Link automatically handles that. The Lead Link can choose to either:</p><ul><li>propose a new role to do just that in governance first, and then fill that role, perhaps with himself, and then take the action.</li><li>or, just take the action first, and then go to governance ASAP to propose the role that is supposed to take this action.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When done properly, the Lead Link will eventually never have to handle "undelegated accountabilities" any more since once any undelegated accountability is&nbsp;discovered, it is brought governance immediately, and the accountability is added to a new role or an existing one.&nbsp;</p><p>Does that sound about right ?</p><p>I'm also curious where this is mentioned in the constitution. I've heard multiple recordings that mention this, but not sure which section of the constitution actually says this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dien.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Then what does it mean for a Lead Link to "control any Domain defined on the Circle" assuming it's un-delegated?</p><blockquote><p>A Circle’s Lead Link inherits the Purpose and any Accountabilities on the Circle itself, and <strong>controls any Domains defined on the Circle, just as if the Circle were only a Role and the Lead Link filled that Role.</strong></p></blockquote>      </ul>

<p>It means from a Super-Circle perspective, the Sub-Circle is just seen as a Role, that such role has the Domain like any other Role control a Domain.</p><p>From a Sub-Circle perspective, it means that every role within the sub-cirle may impact such Domain as family property.</p><p>Is that enough to answer your question?</p>      </ul>
