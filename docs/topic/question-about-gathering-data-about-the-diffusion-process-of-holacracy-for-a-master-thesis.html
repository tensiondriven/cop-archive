<p>Hello Margaux,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>thank you for your kind answer. That's exactly the sort of Information I am intending to gather and accumulate. The only additional Thing that I'd Need, in order to discover the Diffusion is the time aspect. Do you maybe know when each implementation, Workshop, session where, in order to see if the number of People that are interested in Holacracy is rising in time, or not?</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p><p>Best regards<br />Daniel Shatkin</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>In the past 6 years. I can't do a year by year but it is spreading faster and faster - 60 press released in the past 2 years, more and more trainings and workshops with lots of participants.</p>      </ul>
