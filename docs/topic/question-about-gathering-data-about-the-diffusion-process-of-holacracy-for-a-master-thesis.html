      <h4>Question about gathering data about the diffusion process of Holacracy for a master thesis</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<div>Hello fellow peoplehoware interested in Holacracy,</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>My name is Daniel Shatkin and currently I am researching the diffusion process of organizational innovations for my master thesis at the University of Technology at Vienna, Austria. One of the organizational innovations I want to analyse is Holacracy, since it seems to be a fresh and interesting way of governance.<br />For my research of the diffusion process of Holacracy I need information about how many companies decided to implement Holacracy at which date (year, year and month would be more precise though).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So much for explaining my Situation. Does maybe someone have any Information that can lead to gathering insight about the success of Holacracy over the years? The Information can be for instance calendar data of Holacracy implementation Projects at companies, Holacracy book sell numbers or attendance data of Holacracy Events.</div><div>Of course the information can be absolutely anonymous, since I only need data about the Diffusion process.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Help from you would be not only highly appreciated, but crucial for my research and of course your company would be listed at my “Thank You” section.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Please let me know if anyone has any data I can use for my Thesis, or maybe has a clue how to gather it. Thank you!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Best regards<br />Daniel Shatkin</div>    </div>

<p>Hello Margaux,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>thank you for your kind answer. That's exactly the sort of Information I am intending to gather and accumulate. The only additional Thing that I'd Need, in order to discover the Diffusion is the time aspect. Do you maybe know when each implementation, Workshop, session where, in order to see if the number of People that are interested in Holacracy is rising in time, or not?</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p><p>Best regards<br />Daniel Shatkin</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
