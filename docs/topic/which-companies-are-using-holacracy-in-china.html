<p>@Yang Yong I am fully with you re Chinese culture AND I have had the chance during an iGi Partners's client implementation with two major groups having operations in China to coach/teach some chinese people with success and I did not observe much difference with other European culture. I think that more and more the world is fractal and you can find people in Paris 13 more Chinese culture oriented than in Shanghai &nbsp;and vice versa.

<p>We are trying to use Holacracy for a Action Mark. It's a one man army at the moment but we'll see how it goes <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>
