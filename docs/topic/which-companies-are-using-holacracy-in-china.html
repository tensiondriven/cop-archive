<p>@Yang Yong I am fully with you re Chinese culture AND I have had the chance during an iGi Partners's client implementation with two major groups having operations in China to coach/teach some chinese people with success and I did not observe much difference with other European culture. I think that more and more the world is fractal and you can find people in Paris 13 more Chinese culture oriented than in Shanghai &nbsp;and vice versa.
