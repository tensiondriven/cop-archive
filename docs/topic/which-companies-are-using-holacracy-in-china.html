I am excited for Holacracy to flourish in China!&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>hi, tyler</p><p>i think holacracy is more difficult in china. like my words, every chinese maybe has a king heart. you know the important thing is power for chinese king. our culture is these. i know the west culture was arise from ancient Greece. ancient Greece was a trade empire, the contract is the most important for everyone, and Greece is mountainous country, in ancient, traffic is not convenient like present. ancient Greece was a federal state. so, the king of ancient Greece had not more power like chinese king.&nbsp;</p><p>China is a centralized state from 221 B.C. there are many different dynasties in almost 2300 years, but every dynasty was a centralized state. so, centralized power is the most important for every king, bring about our culture that power is important.</p><p>holacracy is separated power system, this is conflicted with chinese culture. so, it's difficult in china.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>@Yang Yong I am fully with you re Chinese culture AND I have had the chance during an iGi Partners's client implementation with two major groups having operations in China to coach/teach some chinese people with success and I did not observe much difference with other European culture. I think that more and more the world is fractal and you can find people in Paris 13 more Chinese culture oriented than in Shanghai &nbsp;and vice versa.
