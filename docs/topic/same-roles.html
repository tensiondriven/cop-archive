  <dd>Same roles</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, I was hoping someone could help me with a small issue I'm trying to resolve. Is it appropriate to have two people fill the same role or should two distinct roles be created if they are identical? In other words, I'm wondering if it is best to create ''Sales rep 1'' and ''Sales rep 2'' or to design a circle that makes it irrelevant to have those roles in the first place. Thanks,</dd>

<p>Sure it could be appropriate, please refer to <a href="%20http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art242" target="_blank">Section 2.4.2</a>&nbsp;of the Constitution. You'll probably need to specify a "focus" :</p><p><em>"As one way of maintaining that clarity, a Lead Link may specify a “Focus” along with each assignment, which is an area or context for that person to focus within while executing in the Role."</em></p><p>I would try this option at the first place and move forward/let tensions surface which will guide you if you just follow them...</p>      </ul>

<p>Yep. Create one single role and assign 2 people, with focus if needed.<br />Hope that helps.</p>      </ul>
