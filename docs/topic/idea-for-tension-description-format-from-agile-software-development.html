      <h4>Idea for tension description format from agile software development</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>One thing I've been doing when capturing tensions for myself is to use a practice from agile software development: writing them in user story format. User stories are used when describing feature requests. The format goes something like this:</p><p>"As &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal/desire&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;."</p><p>For example:&nbsp;</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">"As a Feature Developer, I find it slow to have to parse through new systems without any orientation to the new code and I would like a role to be accountable to orient me, so that I can get up to speed more quickly."</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Basically, it states the role it is coming from, says what you want, and gives a why to help others understand the motivation behind it. Personally, I think it is a good format for other types of requests as well.</span></p>    </div>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p><p>I mainly use the format when typing up my tensions into GlassFrog, but I try to keep it in mind when requesting things of other roles. I think the part that is easy to forget is the "so that", which helps others to understand the why behind it - sometimes what I'm asking for isn't actually going to meet the need, so I think that helps to provide the information to the recipient. But, as a general rule in Holacracy, I feel like you rarely go wrong by telling others what role you are acting from!</p>      </div>

<p>This approach goes a long way toward clarifying in advance what &nbsp;Role needs and why. How do you think this will change the atmosphere of tactical/governance meetings; or is this a way to approach the appropriate role directly? Any approach/tactic that respects that which can happen only in the unique context of the group is good by me.</p>      </div>
