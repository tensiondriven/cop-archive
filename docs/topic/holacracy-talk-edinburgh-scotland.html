  <dd>Holacracy Talk Edinburgh Scotland</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi there. I am one of the organizers of the Lean Agile meet-up group in Edinburgh, Scotland ( https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Agile-Edinburgh/ ). One of the things I've been keen to get on the agenda is a talk about holacracy. I am therefore looking for someone with hands on holacracy experience who is willing to share their story on holacracy. Do you know anyone who might be interested, please get in touch. Ray</dd>

<p>Hi Ray, I'm a Holacracy Coach based in London and partial to a visit to Edinburgh from time to time. Happy to talk about how I can help your group if you'd like to book a time to chat? Sally</p>      </ul>
