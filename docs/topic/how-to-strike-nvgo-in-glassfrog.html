      <h4>How to Strike NVGO in Glassfrog</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I am not a Secretary of any circle and don't know how a Sec would strike any NVGO in Glassfrog. And I am very curious to know&nbsp;how this process happens or if Glassfrog technology has features that facilitate it.</p><p>I imagine there must be and edit/ strike&nbsp;button next to each meeting output available &nbsp;only to the Sec in his/her Glassfrog account. When Sec strikes a meeting output, all data that was attached to that output would be reversed to its original condition. Am I too far off?</p><p>Here is an example: a&nbsp;circle-level 4 was moved out of its Circle-Level 3&nbsp;by LL of Circle-level 2 outside of Governance Process, after the Sec of Circle-Level 2 strikes that NVGO, will that Circle-level 4&nbsp;be back to its original position which was inside Circle-level 3 automatically in Glassfrog? Or should a Cirlce-Level 2 Governance Meeting needed to process a proposal to put it back to where it were?</p><p>Furthermore, if the original Circle-level 4 after being put into Circle-Level 2 was pulled out of Circle-Level 2 into Circle-Level 1 (inside Governance Process), then&nbsp;the Sec of the Circle-Level 2 strikes the above NVGO, will this Circle-Level 1 Governance Output be impacted by the strike in Glassfrog--means the original Circle-level 4 which now becomes a new Circle-level 2&nbsp;will disappear from Circle-Level 1 and be back inside Circle-Level 3?</p><p>Many thanks,</p>    </div>
