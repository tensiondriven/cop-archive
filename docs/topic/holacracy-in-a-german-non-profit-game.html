      <h4>Holacracy in a German Non-Profit-Game.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Here I'am after Holacracy has found me and convinced me to try it in a<br /><strong>non-profit</strong> organisation running a game. About the game:</p><p>For players we offer a game world with extraordinary love<br />to the detail and boundless interaction possibilities, both with the<br />Game world, as well as with the other players. Our world stands as<br />one of a few <strong>German</strong>-speaking online offers also people with poor eyesight.<br />Is open and free of charge.</p><p>The game is a so called <strong>Multi-User-Dungeon</strong> and is up and running since 1992.</p><p>I'm still in process convincing the other adminstrator colleagues to give<br />Holacracy a try. One potential problem to the strict meeting formats for<br />governance and tactical meetings is the human time factor of free will and<br /><strong>free time</strong>. Not everyone, who wants to participate, can attend the same time,<br />as the RL (the <strong>real life</strong> how we call it from the virtual game perspective)<br />comes in the way with higher priorities then "just the game".<br />I want to give the circle members to <strong>participate</strong> e.g. in the governance process<br />even if the cannot make it to the meetings.</p><p>So my questions:<br />1) Who is out there with practice for Non-Profit-Organisations?<br />2) Is some German-speaking holacracy-practicer interested to help in a game?<br />3) I have the additional idea to integrate with the glassfrog-api-v3<br /> from within the game, first on German, to get everything going,<br /> later I can port the code to an English MUD.<br /> So, is anyone interested in a text-only tool/interface to Holacracy?<br /><br />Thanks for the Holacracy-Idea...<br />Myonara.</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Myonara,</p><p>I can only help with one of your questions:</p><p>1) we use holacracy in our non-profit organization and it works well so far.&nbsp; We have challenges with incorporating contractors into the system and are trying to figure out ways to make this work more cleanly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>good luck with the other questions you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>      </div>
