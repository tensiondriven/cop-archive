<p>Hi, I really like the new community forum, and I also appreciate the fact that you have asked for suggestion about which topics should be migrated from the Old Community through a dedicated spreadsheet, &nbsp;however, having joined the community only &nbsp;a few weeks ago I feel like I had just started scraping the surface of the vast amount of content that was available there (videos, calls, discussions), which means I am in no position to really indicate now what I think should be ported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few options:</p><p>- Why not migrate the whole community in a dedicated area of the new one? (You may even want to grant access only to paying subscribers)</p><p>- Why not just leave it up in a different place if you feel that the new one requires a competely new image and structure?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your message. We deliberated over migrating all of the content from the old Community of Practice to the new platform. The final decision was based on 1) a lot of the content was old and may be out of date/inaccurate and 2) cost/feasibility on this platform, which resulted in making a fresh start with new content and the best of threads from the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will take your suggestions into consideration regarding the old Community. Another options is migrating more recent threads into this Community of Practice now that it is active. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Very best,</p><p>Laura</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
