      <h4>Is the role window shopped or assigned by the lead link.</h4>

    <div class="Box-row">
When i began doing holacracy without doing a practitioner training, i had picked up an impression that people window shop for the role they would like to take. Also i saw lead link as a 'weak manager' so assumed that lead link wont do any thing in this and people decide which role they want to take. This landed us in lot of trouble as each person was taking the role they wanted irrespective of their capacity to do it, some were taking a role as they wanted to learn the stuff. Or depending on...    </div>

<p>[@mention:449833773917801859], You mean to say that instead of assigning we can elect all the roles, or we are not bound by the constitution to have the lead link and to have them assign the roles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;lead link accountability in&nbsp; glass frog cannot take any more accountabilities, which implies that lead link can have no more accountabilities than what they are supposed to by the constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>I am curious to hear any other opinions also along with this.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;As stated in constitution section 2.2.3 : "However, a Circle may remove any accountability, or functions of its Lead Link Role, either by placing them on another Role within the Circle, or by defining an alternate means of enacting them."</p><p>As an example, and if required by tension or reality, you may create a Policy that states something like "Instead of Lead Link authority, the roles of the circle will be affected using the integrative election process.". Note, I'm not saying you should do that, I'm just saying technically you may do that in alignment with the Constitution.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;You're right, Holacracy is about a purpose driven organization. Notice that Lead Link is a Role that covers functions required for leading a Circle. Per default in Constitution 4.1, one person fills such Role, but you may change that by distributing such functions on different Roles or processes. For instance, you could decide (by adding a Policy) to elect all the&nbsp;Roles within a Circle, if this was the way used before Holacracy adoption.</p>      </div>
