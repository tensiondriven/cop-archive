  <dd>Hello guys, I was wondering if, as a Facilitator, I can ask the following questions to tension-bringers in Tactical Meetings : Does it limit one of your roles? Which one? I want to ask this question because it seems that most people are demanding actions and bringing tensions that do not directly affect their roles . Is this a pattern that should be addressed? How do you usually handle it? Thanks!</dd>
