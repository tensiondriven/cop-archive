  <dd>Tracking Actions in GF</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>A few actions were recently assigned to me at a Tactical meeting. I have finished them and want to check them off in GF. Other roles in the circle also had actions and I would like to review them like we do with Projects at the next meeting to make sure they have been executed, or to see if they need remediation. I do not see them under projects. How do I update/track an Action? Thanks.</dd>
