      <h4>Corporate formalities/requirements (ex.minutes) in Glassfrog?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello all,</p><p>I've recently started getting familiar with GlassFrog and think I've got the jist of it but still not 100%.</p><p>Does anybody know if GlassFrog can pretty much help with most (if not all) corporate requirements such as minutes (since Glassfrog is a tool to help with governance)</p><p>One of the biggest ways for a lawyer to try to "pierce the corporate veil" is to prove that a corporation/LLC has failed to follow corporate formalities so was thinking that not only would GlassFrog help in using Holacracy, but a 2nd benefit as an online tool for corporate requirements.</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p><p>Cyrus</p>    </div>

<p>In our organization we use the Glassfrog meeting outputs as meeting minutes and we do not take any secondary minutes. The only thing that might be missing is meeting attendance. Otherwise I believe that meets the legal requirement, we use our shared google calendar for attendance documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you Jenn.&nbsp; Much appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>So just to confirm, let's say me and you were in a circle and you were the lead link and I as the secretary.&nbsp; As of right now, there is no way for us to indicate on GlassFrog that we both attended a meeting?&nbsp; Thus, the reason for implementing a shared Google calendar?</p><p>Thanks again!</p>      </div>

<p>Yes, we use the google calendar to announce meetings, solicit rsvps, and because people mark yes/no for attendance it meets the legal requirement of knowing who is at which meetings.</p><p>Anyone can log in to Glassfrog during a meeting by clicking "Join Meeting" but the glassfrog history doesn't show who signed into the meeting. I will say the glassfrog team is always open to feature requests and you could request that.&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Jenn</p>      </div>
