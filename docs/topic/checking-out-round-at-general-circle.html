  <dd>When making a comment at checking out round, who are you allowed to show up as? &nbsp;Can you make a comment as yourself or are you only allowed to show up as your role dictates?&nbsp;</dd>

<p>As the goal of the closing round is to reflect upon the meeting and have&nbsp;closure, you can just be yourself, no need to think in terms of your roles for that one.</p>      </ul>

<p>Yes, as Lynoure said, the goal of the closing&nbsp;round is for people to be reflect on the meeting and give feedback. So you can just express what you feel personally as well as what you feel in your roles.</p><p>I know that in a governance meeting,&nbsp;a common mistake for new facilitators is to call people by their roles when doing the rounds. People are showing up because they have one or more role within the circle, that's for sure but in the meeting,&nbsp;it is the persons here speaking, in service of the organization, their roles.</p>      </ul>
