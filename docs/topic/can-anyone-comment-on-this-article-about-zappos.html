<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>I've found this article recently, and I would like to know what's really going on there.

<p>I would be interested in learning more about the plan that the author offered to share. &nbsp;Organizational evolution is not only supported in&nbsp;Holacracy, it is encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p><em>"I offered a plan to empower teams, and included direct feedback that Zappos employees had given me about the move to Teal and Holacracy."</em></p>      </div>

<p>I also have the experience that it is hard to implement and to change / unlearn / learn new behavior, but also very rewarding. It took my 15-30 people company a year to get good at it, and after 3,5 years we're still learning every day.</p><p>I expect it to remain a constant learning journey. I expect society to take 50+ years to make a real change&nbsp;in the way we organize. Just like we've had 100+ years of optimizing top down management in all it's&nbsp;nuances. And I think it's super hard to change an existing org so dramatically, as Zappos is trying.</p><p>Try to find the articles that are not written from the outside, if you're looking for some confirmation or demystification.

<p>Bud wouldn't be the first person to e-mail Tony to&nbsp;tell him everything he's doing wrong around Holacracy and what to do to fix it (which usually involves using&nbsp;that person's system or consulting services instead)... &nbsp;Zappos and Holacracy are&nbsp;convenient targets for anyone interested in tearing&nbsp;something down to build up their own thing (or for journalists&nbsp;more interested in click-throughs on sensationalized headlines than, say, doing actual journalism).</p><p>Zappos seems to be doing great as far as I can tell,&nbsp;and it looks to me like they're artfully navigating&nbsp;the&nbsp;many&nbsp;challenges that come with&nbsp;a massive transformation and paradigm shift&nbsp;(from my own first-hand experience of them plus&nbsp;lots of conversations with people who work there). &nbsp;Per Ruben's point, if you want to&nbsp;know what's really going on in Zappos (or anywhere), check for first-hand accounts, and be wary of press and management-consultant bloggers...</p><p>Here's&nbsp;two more relevant articles with first-hand accounts (the one Margaux linked to is great as well, especially&nbsp;for a commentary... except the reference to Buffer trying Holacracy - that's a total press&nbsp;fabrication):</p><p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3055657/most-creative-people/the-zappos-exodus-wasnt-about-holacracy-says-tony-hsieh" target="_blank">http://www.fastcompany.com/305...racy-says-tony-hsieh</a></p><p><a href="http://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/item/thanks-for-all-of-your-concern-butan-inside-perspective-on-the-changes-at-zapposcom" target="_blank">http://www.zapposinsights.com/...changes-at-zapposcom</a></p>      </div>

<p>It felt rant-y, not a careful critique (which I'd be very interested in learning from!). It also relies on the implicit premise that once you have an established company/culture, you should only do things which reinforce it, and never consider adjusting/changing direction. The company is changing,&nbsp;and people now have an opportunity to see if it's still a good fit. NBD</p>      </div>

<p>I was dismayed to get this article in my inbox because I am inferring someone spent a lot of time and was very intentional about it.&nbsp;However, I wonder about the motivations and the judgments at play.</p><p>I have visited Zappos twice since last April. And I have been in touch with both Tony and others who are leading the Holacracy effort, and a smaller amount with other individuals within Zappos. I too would be curious to know what specific plan this author put forth, though with the kind of judgments in the article I would have a hard time finding them credible. At Zappos, they&nbsp;have been heads down, working on teal practices and their compensation system, and other aspects of running a business that have always been needed. They work on conflict management, and launching and removing circles, and helping colleagues learn how to own their authority. So the work continues. And I know I don't have the whole picture.</p><p>They are still in the difficult place of shifting paradigms and doing the hard work of evolving their organization. I admire them and do think it is brave what they are doing. And I don't think Holacracy is too difficult for the average worker to adopt, though it is a challenge. That is to be expected. This is part of the reason I am almost the anti sales person when organizations want to adopt Holacracy; I want them to go in with their eyes open to the continued journey Ruben is speaking to.</p><p>Finally, Holacracy simply wasn't born out of theory and I would guess that authors who think so&nbsp;are trying to articulate something valuable, but I don't think they really get the paradigm shift with this kind of commentary. Not sure if that is the kind of discourse you are looking for Alexey. Let me know.</p>      </div>
