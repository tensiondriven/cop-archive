      <h4>Valid Objections?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Dear fellow Holacracy pundits...</p><p>can anyone please provide me with some examples of 'Valid Objections'. It appears to my team that no objection can be 'valid' as mostly they are based on predictive data....and it is difficult to 'prove' how a proposal could cause hard or send the circle backwards, or how a new issue is raised solely by adopting the proposal......</p><p>thanking you in advance</p><p>Danielle</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Danielle,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am grateful for your question, since I am dealing with similar issues. So I can not provide right examples. I would like to join the question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question also inspired thoughts, so let me share my understanding wich may not be right, but others hopefully clarify it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) In my understanding the Objections are to defend the Circle and its Roles, and the Objector is helping the Proposer and enhancing her in resolving her Tension. If I focus on the words: defense, help, enhancement it is easier to let go of the ego and go for cheap experiments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) I believe Proposals are best when are defined as cheap experiments. Defined only in requisite detail in the first round to have space for clarification and amendment. A deep understanding and detailed sharing of the tension - imho - is much much more important that the draft proposal in the first round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) When holacracy is firstly deployed there may be little data avilable and little consciousness to build up Objections in the Circle. Also there is a lot of bias coming from previous decision making habits. In this period I believe the best is to focus on sharing underdefined objection-like concerns in the reaction round and trust the process and the facilitator. When we have little data, the most important Objection validation is "the criteria of high risk" (3.2.4. /c - second part of the paragraph).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) I believe that in this period the human challange is to let go of controll, the need for the big picture, of detailed undertanding. If there is no data for building Objection it is possible to model weather the Proposal could be tried for a short period of time without irreversibele negative consequences and if yes, go on. Trust yourself but also trust the Proposer and the Circle. It is not just your responsibility to defend the circle. You and every Core Circle Member has the chance to call for a Gov meeting the next day via the Secretary and raise a new Proposal to reduce the Tension and the harm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5) Proposers may elaborate their Proposals before they bring it to the meeting. If I have a proposal and expect a Partner to oppose it, I have a chance to discuss my tension and my idea with her to check if my Proposal hurts that role or not. I believe that this is a good practice to have a deeper self awareness about my tension, my connectedness with my Role's Purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
