  <dd>Section 2.6.1 Modifying Sub-circles: Creating roles in Super Circle to push to Sub-circle?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>*“A Circle may also move its own Defined Roles or Policies into a Sub-Circle, or move any from within the Sub-Circle into itself.”* Does this mean I can create a role in the super circle and push it into the sub-circle? ​​ OR does this rule only apply for the moment when a sub-circle is created? *An**ne Nynke Jansma* Sales | Events | Process | Hiring www.springest.nl *T: *085 303 2830 *E:* info@springest.nl</dd>

<p>Hi Anne,</p><p>from my understanding "constitutionally" you can always create a role in the super-circle and then immediately push it down to the sub-circle within the same Governance meeting.</p><p>My question here is if this is "good Holacracy practice". Generally the&nbsp;super-circle creates the context of the sub-circle but how the sub-circle then enacts its purpose and accountabilities is up to the sub-circle and NOT the super-circle.</p><p>Also: From the level of the super-circle the sub-circle is only a role, filled by the Lead Link of the sub-circle.</p><p>So from my point of view it really depends on the tension that you are trying to solve. Would adding an accountability to the whole sub-circle also solve your tension and then the sub-circle could find out themselves what they want do with this added accountability within? Then this would be my favorable move.</p><p>Best,</p>      </ul>
