  <dd>Hi, As internal Holacracy coach, I'd like to be able to see the proposals being sent on asynchronous mode. As we are in the early stage on some circles, and I cannot attend to all governance meetings, detecting NVGO proposals upfront is a good opportunity for coaching either the proposer or the facilitator before the meeting. One way to do that would be to add myself as member of all the circles, without any role, however the process is actually requesting me an answer for all the proposals...</dd>
