      <h4>Secretary recording outputs of Tactical Meetings?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p class="p1">Unless I am missing something, I think&nbsp;this question may be a matter of interpretation of the&nbsp;constitution: do outputs from Tactical Meetings form part of the "constitutionally-required records of the circle" which are the domain of the Secretary?</p><p class="p1">I see 4.2.3.e says that ‘the Secretary is responsible for capturing’ Tactical Meeting outputs, but does that mean that they fall under the above domain and so someone else can’t do it without the Secretary's permission?</p><p class="p1">The reason I ask is that when facilitating a Tactical Meeting, one participant was getting frustrated with the Secretary being slow in recording the meeting outputs and he wanted to record his own actions/projects himself in the meeting outputs. My reading is that this would have been fine only&nbsp;if the&nbsp;Secretary &nbsp;had given permission.&nbsp;</p>    </div>
