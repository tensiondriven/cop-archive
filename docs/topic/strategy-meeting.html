<p>It would be very helpful for us, if you share experiences with strategy meeting forms working with the Holacracy Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>We work quite a while with Holacracy but we do Strategic Meetings like we did before. And maybe there are some interesting practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks a lot for comments</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Sibylle,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HolacracyOne has a published Policy within their records called "Strategy Meeting Process" this is supported through a Policy set in the Board Circle granting authority. I have included the link to it, it is good reference as it accommodates the role of the Lead-link elegantly as per 2.2.2 Defining Priorities &amp; Strategies. Just be mindful it is an internal document and not part of the Constitution or Rules:&nbsp;<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/272" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/272</a></p>      </div>

<p>Hi Sibyllle,</p><p>As I know, there is not specific "constitution process" for the&nbsp; strategy Meeting. I set up several strategy meeting using a kind of home made process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main idea is :</p><p>A - Looking at the company/circle's environment from a very large perspective to a focused one, in order to check paradigm changes, news from the last period, "low voltage" signals, learnings...</p><p>B - Setting an agenda from tension sensed through the circle members</p><p>C - Processing each tension trough the IDM process in order to set strategic focuses</p><p>D - Building the main strategy using the strategic focuses</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We detailed all the process in very specific steps, starting by a check-in round and ending by a closing round.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before that, the LL has to delegate to the circle her/his strategic accountability trough a policy adopted in a governance meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
