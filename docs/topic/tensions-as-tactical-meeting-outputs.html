  <dd>Tensions as Tactical Meeting Outputs?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Anyone have an experience of this? Looking for some examples. Trying to give Secretaries some guidance in what's appropriate to capture as outputs. Genesis was a Secretary who wrote every tension and how it was processed (action/project), which generated a very unhelpful post-meeting email lol.</dd>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That feature is only to capture tensions to bring to governance so when in a tactical meeting you identify something you need to process in a governance meeting (for instance an implicit expectation that need to be explicit in governance with a clear accountability), instead of taking an action “Bring to the next governance meeting...”, you can just select “Tension” and put the content of the tension so that the tension owner will have it directly in his governance tension list, free to prepare (or not) the tension.</p><p>So it is only for governance tensions. I hope GlassFrog will have a list for tactical tensions as well soon.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>      </ul>

<p>With new groups, I tend not to use that because they don't know how to use the “My Tensions” tab but as soon as they know, I propose to capture it directly as a tension but they are still free to choose.</p>      </ul>

<p>Yeah, that's where I discovered it; otherwise it wouldn't have occurred to me as a possible tactical output. You just gave me the idea to actually test it, and I noticed that it only allows it to be assigned to individuals, not roles, and it pushes it into their tensions for governance.</p><p>I would've thought these tensions would be processed as a next-action to develop a proposal for governance. Is it better to capture them as a tension?</p>      </ul>
