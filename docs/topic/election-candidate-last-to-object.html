  <dd>Election - Candidate Last To Object?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Anybody have an idea why it is required or useful that the candidate be the last Circle Member to be offered the chance to Object? It has seemed to me to be counter-intuitive - that the candidate may be the most likely to object, based on not wanting to do the job (objection 'too busy - already Facilitator in 2 other circles'). I'd love to understand this - does anyone have idea or experience about why the candidate goes last? Thanks</dd>
