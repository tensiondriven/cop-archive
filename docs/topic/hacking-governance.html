      <h4>Hacking governance?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Yesterday I went through a new experience during a governance meeting. Somebody, experienced in Holacracy, proposed to do a "discussion" through the governance process.</p><p>3.2.2 was respected so I went through it, even if I felt necessary to add a disclaimer (on a quick timeout) on the strange&nbsp;experience that this proposal might have provoked. We want through the normal process, up to&nbsp;NVGOs&nbsp;and integration. At integration,&nbsp;once we had found some valid&nbsp;governance output, the proposer, surprisingly, decided to remove her proposal. It was probably a way to raise urgently attention on a point that for her was important, and it&nbsp;put in light out some hidden points in governance but it left me with a strange feeling of having&nbsp;hacked the system to introduce some political discussion without accepting to take ownership. I do not know if I am clear, but I wonder if&nbsp;others facilitators/coaches went through a similar experience and if you have some feedback/advice. Thanks.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>    </div>
