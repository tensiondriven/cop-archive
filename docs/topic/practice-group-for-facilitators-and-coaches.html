  <dd>Hi everyone, We are looking for Facilitators and Coaches who would like to meet online each week to master the skills, discuss the nitty-gritty of the Constitution, etc. The idea is to create a company in Glassfrog to create an environment where we could gain more insight. We have two Coaches on board ( Tom Mulder and myself). The company, rules, etc. to be created evolutionary. Please reach out if you would like to join. Best, Ewa</dd>
