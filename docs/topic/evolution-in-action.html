<p>We are in H for 9 month, and what is obvious our company is evolving all time.</p><p>When talking to new members or to people from outside, it would be very useful to have some method to show how we evolve.</p><p>If we could transform our GF structure into a movie - showing governance output of&nbsp;some period, i.e. from beginning until now then it would be very useful.</p><p>I think it could be also useful for us to see, where is more movement in which part of company, in what roles, in what areas….</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can try to do it manually, but it would be very time-consuming, still I can imagine it should be not so difficult to add this as function to GF? - &nbsp;I would be very grateful.... <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>How about it?</p>    </div>

<p>I don't really know how it looks on Facebook, but I thought about some "biological" cartoon... - to see how cells divide, move from circle to circle, rotate, change size (?), content and ownerships.</p><p>For beginning just roles and circles - that would be more than enough <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Warmly,</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:519784817122741229], are you envisioning something like Facebook's auto-generated movies that show friendships or year in review movies?</p>      </div>

<p>Mikolaj,&nbsp; thanks for your ideas and request.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would it be sufficient to be able to go to a point in time and have GlassFrog go back to how the organization looked then (and then be able to choose another point in time, etc.)?&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new member of a circle or role I often review the history of these to get a feel for how things have evolved.&nbsp; I gather that you're looking for something a bit more visual?</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:519784817122741229]&nbsp;thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; I have submitted this as a feature request and we appreciate your input.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, if you have any additional information not previously shared as to how this supports your Holacracy practice, that would be helpful in terms of prioritization.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi!</p><p>Possibility to see the structure at any given date would be perfect!</p><p>Then maybe next step can be adding the possibility to move along the "time line" to see how it evolved?</p><p>Looking forward to see some of it! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>
