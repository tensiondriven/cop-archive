      <h4>Delegation of domains across several layers of the holarchy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row">
Hey [@mention:455886150941203371], thanks for your article on Understanding Domains — helpful as always. I have some questions regarding the delegation of domains across several layers of the holarchy. As you have outlined in the last paragraph of the article, a circle can only further delegate a domain to a role within its circle which has been previously granted the right to control by the super-circle. In other words: you cannot give away control over what you haven’t been given before...    </div>

<p>Hey Dennis!&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p"><strong>1) I checked the constitution but couldn’t any reference to a “law of inherited domains” or something like that. Is this really undefined in the constitution or am I just missing it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p">Hmmm...well, some of it may be extrapolation/simplification of what is written. Though, there is this part at the bottom of 2.1.3, "In any case, all Domain delegations are always limited to whatever authority the Circle itself had in the first place."</p><p class="graf graf--p"><strong>2) If I, as a facilitator of a super-circle, should find in the Governance records that two of 'my' sub-circles have defined domains that my circle hasn't granted them exclusive access previously - is that a case of invalid governance that needs to be stricken out (e.g. both the&nbsp;<em>Marketing</em>&nbsp;circle and the&nbsp;<em>IT</em>&nbsp;circle secured "the company's homepage")? Or&nbsp;are these domain definition just something that everybody outside of these two sub-circles can happily ignore since it only regulates&nbsp;access on the sub-circle level (e.g. within&nbsp;<em>Marketing</em>&nbsp;or within&nbsp;<em>IT</em>)?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p">If they haven't been given to either sub-circle <em>from</em> the super-circle, then it's invalid governance. I would lean on 3.2 which defines how governance can be changed (i.e. no&nbsp;objections, etc.) because essentially it's as if a role (Marketing, or IT) changed the governance of the <em>circle</em>&nbsp;without following due process. Like if a child suddenly declared that they controlled the family car.&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p">Now, if a role within the sub-circle, say Marketing Maven inside the Marketing circle, could propose the domain "the company's homepage," and that would be "legal, but ignorable." Like if a child declared that their teddy bear controlled the family car.&nbsp;Then, Barbie, GI Joe, and the other toys in the child sub-circle would have to check with Teddy, but everyone else in the family could happily ignore it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p"><strong>3) What would be the appropriate pathway for a sub-circle that wants to secure company-wide exclusive control over a domain? Would it try to obtain the domain allocation via Rep Link from the next higher level recursively, until it reaches GCC which legitimizes the delegation downward from there?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p">Yes, I think so. I mean, I have a sense that the role which seeks control should be able to go straight to the GCC to propose that, but I don't think I can find a justification for that in the current rules. Maybe that will change in v5. So, yes, for now, I would say do what you describe. And if there are like, 3 or more layers, then that's a pain, but a necessary one to make sure there are no objections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p">&nbsp;</p><p class="graf graf--p"><strong>4) Does anyone else sense a tension that the constitution could be clearer and more explicit on this?</strong></p><p class="graf graf--p">It's an interesting question, because I sense the need for more explanation, but not sure of the&nbsp;appropriate level of detail to provide in the constitution itself. I often think of how practitioners of different religions rely upon a history of commentary on their primary religious texts. Or, how in&nbsp;chess, you have the official rules, but the really interesting things are all of the strategies...the openings, the set-ups, counters, etc. So, for me, I'm focusing on building up the commentary and letting the rules handle the basics. With that said, there is a sliding scale and I think the constitution v5 will make some of these things easier to get.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:457856795977603624]&nbsp;the part with Car control =&gt; child =&gt; Teddy =&gt; GI Joe is the best&nbsp;storyline i've seen so far to explain how domains work <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>IMHO, the constitution should be improved here =&gt; make it more clear</p><p>The reason why I think it's not clear is simple: there are always a lot of questions and answers come in metaphors. If it would be clear and easy to understand, there would not be as many questions... I would appreciate clarification</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Awesome response&nbsp;@Chris Cowan!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>re 2 - I am a fan of the “GI Joe” route above the “article 3.2” route. As a starting point I would use that what happens in a circle stays in a circle (from the outside I would consider its governance a black box and none of my interest). In your methaphor language: My two kids are definitely ok with having their own domains in their own circle. Any interference I do from the “family GCC” is definitely not found useful. And if I am part of their circle I just play along. So your metaphor definitely holds true! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>re 3 - one alternative: go straight to the role that cares (maybe the Lead link of the “global marketing circle”? Or the GCC LL?) And ask them to propose it and then work downwards. Might be less painful than working upwards a couple of layers. But if you find that the role actually doesn’t care about it the rep link ascend is definitely the way to go.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Greetings from family holiday!</p><p>koen</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Chris, thanks for your reply. Once again you found&nbsp;useful metaphors and examples to drive home your point. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>
