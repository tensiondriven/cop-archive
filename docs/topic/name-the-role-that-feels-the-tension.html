      <h4>Name the Role that Feels the Tension</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Check out <a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/sneak-peek-holacracy-habits-56ad57d54ae1" target="_blank">this sneak peak</a> of the first Holacracy Habit that GlassFrog's habit support program focuses on (it's one of many habits &amp; lessons over the 6-month base program): &nbsp;Name the Role that Feels the Tension.</p><p>If you're not using GlassFrog, try getting your whole team focused on this habit for a few weeks, and see what impact it has and if it helps. &nbsp;Consider adding an item to your&nbsp;tactical meeting checklists to create some focus on the habit, and do something to remind people about it regularly (GlassFrog sends a lesson or tip about it every other day, so those of you using GlassFrog can rely on that for reminders). &nbsp;If your team is fairly new to Holacracy, it's a critical habit to build - it unlocks much of Holacracy's benefit, and you're unlikely to sustain Holacracy without it. &nbsp;If you've not so new to Holacracy and you've already&nbsp;got a critical mass of skill in this habit, consider&nbsp;focusing on it anyway to take your game up a level - there's always room for deeper&nbsp;practice.</p><p>If you have any experiences to share about building (or deepening) this habit, please share them here in reply - I'd love to hear about them! &nbsp;And if this habit is helpful, we've got a lot more coming after this one if you're a GlassFrog user - we're baking a lot of&nbsp;Holacracy coaching expertise into GlassFrog. &nbsp;Hope these habits&nbsp;help all of you as much as I've seen them&nbsp;help our consulting clients!</p>    </div>

<p>That indeed was very helpful when we started implementing! To change mindsets, we demanded that everyone stated from which role s/he was asking something of which other role. That helped clarify a lot what role had the tension and what other role was&nbsp;thought able to&nbsp;(help) solve it.</p>      </div>
