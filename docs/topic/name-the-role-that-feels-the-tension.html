Check out this sneak peak of the first Holacracy Habit that GlassFrog's habit support program focuses on (it's one of many habits &amp; lessons over the 6-month base program): Name the Role that Feels the Tension. If you're not using GlassFrog, try getting your whole team focused on this habit for a few weeks, and see what impact it has and if it helps. Consider adding an item to your tactical meeting checklists to create some focus on the habit, and do something to remind people about it...    </div>

<p>That indeed was very helpful when we started implementing! To change mindsets, we demanded that everyone stated from which role s/he was asking something of which other role. That helped clarify a lot what role had the tension and what other role was&nbsp;thought able to&nbsp;(help) solve it.</p>      </div>
