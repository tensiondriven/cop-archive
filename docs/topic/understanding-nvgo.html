  <dd>Understanding NVGO</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I am often confused of NVGO. I also know that policy is to be restrictive then how can we create a compensation policies. I saw some people use the word 'must' which almost makes an action restrictive. Can some one throw more light. I am also sharing our compensation policy for people to see and comment, if any part of it needs to be framed differently, or modified for being outside the process or is NVGO. Look forward to responses. Shammi</dd>
