  <dd>Validity of Removing A Role</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I'm our Knowledge Base Custodian and we no longer have a need for an internal knowledge base, something which everyone agrees. I'm trying to think how to frame my tension to connect it to my purpose / accountabilities being inhibited. Does anyone have suggestions around that when it comes to removing a role that's no longer needed? I'm also our Social Technologist (running point on our holacracy rollout), so I'm trying to be a good role model (lol). Here is the role: Purpose: To make our...</dd>

<p>@Fred, I'd be curious to know what led you to find the Knowledge Base useless? That tension must be grounded on something like a concrete situation where you experienced that it wasn't useful. That might be what you are looking for <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>Agree with Margaux.</p><p>Just bring your tension in a gov meeting "The&nbsp;Base Custodian role I enact is useless regarding that we don't have any need for an internal knowledge base"</p><p>Make a starting proposal "I propose to delete the&nbsp;Base Custodian role".</p><p>Then process it&nbsp; using the IDM process. And you'll see what happen.</p><p>Hope that helps,</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks for the replies!</p><p>@Margaux: I decided (as Knowledge Base Custodian) after seeking input from Rep Links at the most recent GCC tactical meeting. By "everyone" I meant all the GCC members. No one has the explicit authority to remove the knowledge base - probably won't raise a tension to clarify since it would be a short-lived clarification.</p><p>I'm using "team members" colloquially. We have not adopted the Constitution (yet) so we don't have any governance outside of GlassFrog.</p>      </ul>

<p>Dear Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think that might help:</p><h4>3.2.2 Criteria for Valid Proposals</h4><p>“[...]&nbsp;Finally, a Proposal is always valid regardless of the preceding criteria if it is made solely to help evolve the Circle’s Governance to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening, or to trigger a new election for any Elected Role.”</p><p>Here, I think your tension is just to reflect what's happening, i.e. not using that role because you don't have any knowledge base anymore. You still have to bring it to governance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, I would like to ask you a question: who decided to remove the knowledge base? What role? You say “everyone agrees”. “Everyone” doesn't exist in Holacracy. Who&nbsp;has&nbsp;the authority?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, in the description of the role you provided, there are terms like “team members”, I'd be curious to know what is a team member, is it clearly defined in the governance records?</p>      </ul>
