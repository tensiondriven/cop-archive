  <dd>Using Rep-Link vs. direct tension solving</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We are running a Holacracy that currently has 3 hierarchy levels. Let's imagine the levels: GCC - Level 1 Operations - Level 2 Operations Germany - Level 3 A tension is felt on Level 3 by the Project Manager role. This role thinks that the tension would be adequately solved by adding accountabilities to a role in the GCC - Level 1. From my point of view there are two ways of solving this tension: 1) By reaching out to the Rep Link of Level 3 to present the tension to the Rep Link of Level 2...</dd>

<p>Another approach might be to just cut out some steps.&nbsp; What if the Project Manager reached out directly to LL or RL of Level 2, or to LL or another role within Level 1, asking if they sensed the same tension and would be willing to act on it in Level 1 governance?&nbsp; I suggest this not as an attempt to cut out or undermine RL of Level 3, but just to accelerate the process -- particularly where the individuals likely know each other, sense the tensions, etc.</p>      </ul>

<p>Max, I think that you should escalate the tension to the level above through governance only if the whole circle feels it like a tension. 2 levels above might mean that super-circle also feels this tension.</p><p>If this is not the case then I would go to the role which can resolve my tension and ask directly.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Max,</p><p>As you mentionned, and as underlined by Bernard Marie, the 2nd way doesn't seem valid, because even if you invite the member, the role which feel the tension and has authority to bring it isn't&nbsp;in the GCC.&nbsp;</p><p>I share some comments on your 1st way which as you said is ok :</p><p>As you don't need to wait for Tactical meetings to interact with the Rep link, you can directly go to him and present your tension. Then the Rep link of Level 3 can directly bring it to the Rep link of Level 2.</p><p>To my mind, the fact that there are 2 levels to cross doesn't mean it will necessarily be long. For example, if you present by email your tension and proposal, and Rep link level 3 and Rep link level 2 understand and agree with the proposal, Rep link Level 2&nbsp;can have done a Governance proposal out of Governance meeting a few minutes after you wrote to Rep Link Level 3.&nbsp;</p><p>That looks like quite a long journey for a tension, but I personnally wouldn't look for an alternative way. Because I guess that if the proposal doesn't bring new tensions, this may be in reality a quick journey. And if it's long, it may be because that proposal rise new tensions from the perspective of other roles and circles, and in that case, it seems to me that the 1st way is the better to deal with them. The third&nbsp;situation (= everybody is ok with the proposal at every Level but that take a long time to be brought to Governance Level 1 and adopted) may bring you to feel a new tension (A rep link taking too long to process &nbsp;for example ?), and to process it.</p><p>Have a good day</p>      </ul>

<p>@Artem, you are right regarding the Rep Link. Bernard was referring to way number 2 which is becoming a Core Circle Member for one meeting only.</p><p>[@mention:476716727643924128]&nbsp;This would work as well for me if you actually find someone who feels the exact same tension in the super-circle.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p><p>thanks for your words. This resonates with me. As you said: It <strong>seems</strong> like a long process. Let see how quick it turns out. Thanks for all the advice!</p>      </ul>
