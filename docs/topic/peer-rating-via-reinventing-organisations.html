      <h4>Peer Rating via Reinventing Organisations</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello Guys,</p><p>I just finished reading Reinventing Organisations (and subsequently, the yellow book) and am very interested in the peer rating system mentioned in Reinventing Orgs.</p><p>Described in this book is a model where each person is asked two questions;<br />1. Rate &lt;x's&gt; impact compared to yours on a scale of -3 to 3<br />2. How qualified is &lt;x&gt; to rate your impact 1 to 5</p><p>Has anyone developed a spreadsheet or something that helps work all this out?&nbsp;</p><p>On another note, I find it interesting that this model is not described in the yellow book. Is there a reason for that?&nbsp;</p><p>regards,<br />dk-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Denis - The model you describe is what HolacracyOne used before they moved to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/badge-based-compensation-app/" target="_blank">Badge Based Compensation</a> approach, so I'm guessing that's why it doesn't appear in the Holacracy book.</p><p>-Eric</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Yeah, guessing Eric is right; HolacracyOne's compensation system has been upgraded and perhaps that is why Brian didn't write about the old one in the Holacracy book. That was a process based comp system, which at least compensation was:</p><ul><li>determined by more than one person</li><li>process was transparent</li><li>included an algorithm that was objective, even though it included subjective inputs</li></ul><p>It was still very subjective and messy, but may be a better and more feasible next step than a full badge based system for some organizations. If you write us, someone may be able to dig up the spreadsheet and send to you or publish:</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/contact/" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/contact/</a></p><p>On a related note, August has published their compensation system which is an algorithm and they are also willing to share the "source code" if you contact them. As far as I know, they don't practice Holacracy, though from a quick read, it follows a good number of principles that would make it worthy of consideration for a transparent processed based comp app in a Holacracy run organization:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/21st-century-organizational-development/the-august-open-compensation-model-for-self-managed-organizations-69f2c5d9649c#.v26ukukln" target="_blank">https://medium.com/21st-centur...2c5d9649c#.v26ukukln</a></p>      </div>

<p>Hi Karilen,</p><p>I'd very much like it if you could dig up the spreadsheet.</p><p>I'm not at a point of basing compensation on this method yet. But more interested in exposing peer ratings.. Compensation is too big a bear for me to wrestle at this stage.</p><p>Looking forward to your response,<br />dk-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I haven't been able to locate the spreadsheet, but if I do I will share Denis. Is it accurate that you are looking to devise a process for peer feedback rather than a compensation system?</p><p>Can you say more about the tension if it is not compensation (the big bear!)? Maybe we can help in other ways if so.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Karilen,</p><p>At this stage, we are not a Holacracy organisation. I finished the yellow book one week ago. So, we don't have any tensions. : )</p><p>I thought the peer rating model as described in Reinventing Orgs could be useful in any context when you want to get a grasp of your impact compared to your peers.</p><p>Thanks for trying. I will try and work on a spreadsheet myself and may publish said spreadsheet when I complete it.</p><p>thanks,<br />dk-</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ok Guys, as I suggested above, here is the spreadsheet.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eKyLrE2zKE1dUrNgAz5qxMyHdrWo1oW-aZOgDWFE0z4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spread...0z4/edit?usp=sharing</a></p><p>As expected, it's quite simple, once you transpose the axes.</p><p>Looking at the "totals", it seems like I'll be using only the ranking of the peers, rather than the totals.</p><p>The outcome I'm looking for is for this ranking to be input into peer discussions that canvas the question, "what's holding me back from being more impactful?".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Denis,</p><p>thanks for the spreadsheet! It looks pretty handy&nbsp;to me. I'm currently working with a team that&nbsp;wants to adapt a peer rating system and I will to talk to them about some possibilities I see in reference ot Reinventing Organizations. I'll meet them tomorrow and will gladly show them your spreadsheet as one way they could do it.</p><p>If ever they choose to adapt this, I will report back with some feedback and learnings I get.&nbsp;</p><p>So, thanks again - that spreadsheet came just in time. :-)</p><p>Daniel</p>      </div>
