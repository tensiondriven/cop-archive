  <dd>Hey folks, over at encode.org we've formulated what we call five markers of the New World of Work. purposeful holarchic autonomous dynamic transparent Here's a blog post that explains them a little deeper This may come as a bit of a surprise, but they all go together really well with Holacracy-practice. ;-) I am interested to hear how this list lands for you. Is there an aspect missing in your view? Any items that seem superfluous? Your feedback is welcome.</dd>

<p>Hey Andrew,&nbsp;</p><p>interesting one. I like it.&nbsp;</p><p>I would ascribe the drive for Mastery as a quality to the Worker in the New World of Work - the "Purpose Agent".&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, when trying to come up with a characterization of the Purpose Agent (which is still work in progress) this came up high on my list, too. I'll bookmark that book, thanks!</p><p>Do you see mastery a trait of the new world of work <em>itself,&nbsp;</em>or of the <em>worker</em> in the new world of work? I tend towards the latter.&nbsp;</p><p>best,&nbsp;</p><p>Dennis&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p><p>I can see the argument for it being a Worker characteristic, however, I wonder if there's a counter argument relating to the difference between a company's market capitalisation and the book value of its tangible assets - the intangible value.</p><p>The Intellectual Capital framework gives a sound explanation for the gap - people capital, relationship capital and structural capital in some combination.</p><p>All this points to the importance of individual and organisational learning by doing/experimentation, and capturing and deploying that learning/experimentation.</p><p>I assume that an organisation that's adopted Holacracy has a better chance of releasing and encouraging the creative capacity of the people that work in it than other systems of governance.</p><p>Maybe when you expand on "dynamic", it's something in this direction that you have in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Andrew</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Dennis</p><p>From the work of Daniel H. Pink - Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us - his answer:</p><p>Purpose, Autonomy and Mastery.</p><p>You've got the first two - suggest adding mastery to the list.</p><p>To quote from Chapter 5 of that book:</p><p>"Mastery is the desire to get better and better at something that matters".</p>      </ul>
