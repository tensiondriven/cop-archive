      <h4>Secretary and Facilitator as single Roles?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Article 2.3 states the Core Circle Members are: Partners filling Defined Roles, Lead Link, Rep Link(s) to the Circle and Cross Link(s) to the Circle (+ special appointments).</p><p>It struck me that&nbsp;Secretary and Facilitator were not mentioned. Why is this?</p><p>Article 2.5 states that only Core Circle Members may be elected to Rep Link, Facilitator and Secretary. So they (the Partners&nbsp;filling an Elected Role) are Core Circle Members no matter what.&nbsp;</p><p>So essentially, this means that a Partner may not fill a single Secretary or Facilitator Role. Is this correct, and why is this? It could&nbsp;be even be seen as useful to have an outsider as a 'neutral observer' fulfilling this Role...&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>[@mention:549481866316609505]&nbsp;and if it's desirable for someone outside the circle to be elected Facilitator or Secretary, the Lead Link can always appoint them Core Circle Members, then they are eligible.</p><p>See article 2.3.4:</p><blockquote><h4>2.3.4 Special Appointments of Core Members</h4><p>The Lead Link of a Circle may specially appoint additional persons to serve as Core Circle Members of a Circle, beyond those required by this Constitution, and may further remove these special appointments at any time.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:549481866316609505]</p><p>I guess the reason why the Facilitator and the Secretary are not mentioned is because they are elected from the Partners filling a defined role.</p><p>The LL is appointed by the Super Circle, The RepLink to the circle is defined by the Sub-Circle and the CrossLink &nbsp;is defined by the Linked Entity. That is why they are mentioned seperatly together with the Partners filling a defined role.</p><p>For your second question I echo the thoughts of [@mention:449693036337664795]</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, only core circle members can be elected as Secretary or Facilitator. My interpretation is that it does mean that a Partner may not fill only the Secretary or Facilitator role in a circle, unless they've been elected before when they were assigned to a role and were removed recently (but, in this case, are they core circle members? Good question!). The reasons I&nbsp;can see for that rule is that:</p><p>1- it takes time to attend meetings so more efficient to have one or more roles involved in the meeting</p><p>2- both roles need to be intimate with the governance records, knowing the different roles and authorities at play to interpret if needed (for the secretary) or to audit it (facilitator)</p><p>At the beginning, for new circles, we do recommend to have an outsider “neutral” though...</p>      </div>
