  <dd>"Who" can hire/fire the person holding the Lead Link Role in GCC (in HolacracyOne) ?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, I am in the process of designing a viable partnership &amp; investment incentive for my startup (Action Mark) which needs to take into account Holacracy as its Governance. After some initial designing, I quickly discovered that it's very similar to what HolacracyOne already has - as described in the Operating Agreement. Glad someone beat me to it. (just like how I discovered Holacracy in the first place) Some questions I still have regarding the power structure: 1. "Who" can hire/fire...</dd>

<p>Also note the answer&nbsp;Jean-Michel gave is about removing from the role, not firing, which is a different matter in Holacracy...</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Yang,</p><p>Chapter 5 of the Constitution will give you a few landmarks... You may also refer to the Holacracy Book.</p><ol><li>The LL of the GCC is appointed by the LL of the anchor circle (or, if any LL, by the anchor circle through an IDM process decision).</li><li>Up to you to create the Anchor Circle from the existing board. Each member will have to ratify the constitution.</li><li>Actually, your questions sound to be... tensions. Seems you need to build the proper apps to fit your needs.</li></ol><p>Hope that helps,<br /> Jean-Michel</p>      </ul>
