  <dd>Governance tensions not felt by role held by the proposer</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I seem to recall that in Practitioners Training we were taught that Facilitators should discourage or even restrict Governance proposals not felt by a role held by the proposer. I recall that the logic was to prevent 'designing' rather than change the governance structure 'tension-driven'. However, I cannot find any limitations or guidance in the Constitution. Am I missing something? Who can shed some light on this? Thanks, Jan Willem</dd>
