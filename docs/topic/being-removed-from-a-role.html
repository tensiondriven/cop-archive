  <dd>If a lead link wishes to remove someone from a role how are they supposed to do this, does it have to be done in a governance meeting or can the lead link do this whenever they see fit? Also reasons for removing someone from a role: Are there any specific criteria why someone should be remove from a role? or for example can a lead link use an excuse for example "I don't trust your word anymore"? Thanks in advance</dd>
