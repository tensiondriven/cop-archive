  <dd>Being visible as a holacracy company</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello everyone, At my internship company we are using holacracy for about half a year now. Still I mentioned that the company is not visible as a holacracy company on the internet. Does someone has any tips for how to become visible on the 'holacracy-internet'? Is it just marketing or are there some sites where you can register on as a holacracy company to connect to a open holacracy list or so? Kind regards, Dion</dd>
