      <h4>Holacracy &amp; Volunteers</h4>

    <div class="Box-row">
I'm curious if anyone has experience with working with Holacracy and volunteers. We have upwords of 10 volunteers working at our organization on a regular basis and I'm really interested in them having autonomy and clearly defined roles so they are free to take action, but it seems odd to have them have a role for the 3 hours they are at the company.

<p>My last comment was incorrect so i am deleting it and trying again. Role fillers who voluntarily agree to fill a role without financial reimbursement can fill a role in the organization.
