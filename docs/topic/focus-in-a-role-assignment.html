      <h4>Focus in a role assignment</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row">
want to understand what are the reasons for having focus? To solve Which tension is the idea of focus created? Is it just to define the time for some one to be in the role. Or is it sharing some part of the accountabilities that this person can take and a role's accountabilities are divided amongst two to three people by giving them a focus. If that is so, then is it not better to create a new role? Like to hear from those who find it useful and apply it in their practice. How does this help...    </div>
