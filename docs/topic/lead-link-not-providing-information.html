  <dd>Lead link not providing information</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>In our Facilitator practice group we encountered the following. A Partner has a tension that he needs strategic information from the Super Circle to fulfill the purpose of one of his roles. As the Lead Link is not providing this info the Partner wanted to add an Accountability to the Lead Link that he has to provide transparency around the Strategy. As Glassfrog, in line with article 2.2.3, does not provide the possibility to add Accountabilities to the Lead Link role we were wondering how...</dd>

<p>Hi Tom,</p><p>“A Partner has a tension that he needs strategic information from the Super Circle to fulfill the purpose of one of his roles”&nbsp;is a constraint that limits the Sub-Circle to be removed within the Super-Circle, which is the exact accountability of the Rep Link.<br /><br /> However, I'd try to solve the tension directly in the Sub-Circle instead of escalating the issue, in order to build a more “ autonomous” option. Note that "Bringing information to the circle” is not a LL accountability". Consequently, LL is not due to give information... so may be there is a lack of role somewhere.</p><p>For instance, you may create in the Sub-Circle a "Strategic information" role whose accountability could be "Bringing all strategic information needed by the circle"... or even directly add this accountability to the Rep Link Role.</p><p>What about?</p><p>Regards</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey&nbsp;[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;-&nbsp;if the tension is only to get the information, then I would go directly to any Circle Member of the Super-Circle and ask the question!&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Yes we use Glassfrog but do not use the strategy part of the Circles. So full transparancy is there. All strategy items should be mentioned in the Circle environment in Glassfrog.</p><p>Thanks.</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:450538002759581166]&nbsp;/ [@mention:449833773917801859]. Thanks for the reply.</p><p>So, if the LL is not the one to provide the Super Circle strategy and we want to have this on a regular bases the best option is (1)&nbsp;add an accountability&nbsp;to the rep link role as&nbsp;he/she is part of the Super Circle meeting structure or (2) have the&nbsp;Rep Link to&nbsp;address the tension of missing the strategy information in the Super Circle and ask&nbsp;for transparancy on this subject (maybe via a Policy).&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;I'm just curious - are you using GlassFrog tool? and are you referring to Strategy as defined per Constitution in Section 2.2.2&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art222" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art222</a> ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Tom,<br />May be it wont be enough, but you can also have a look on GlassFrog: the strategy of the super-Circle is supposed to be captured on the circle page (left column)</p>      </ul>
