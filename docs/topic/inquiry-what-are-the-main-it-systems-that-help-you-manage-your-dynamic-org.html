<p>We use the full Google Apps suite: e-mail, calendar, shared cloud storage, google docs &amp; sheets, etc. &nbsp;I really like the functionality of it all and the collaboration&nbsp;it enables for our virtual team, though the usability of Google Drive is pretty painful for me, and I still use Excel over Google Sheets for&nbsp;many things. &nbsp;Still, I'm very pleased with the solution overall.</p><p>We also use Slack, which has almost entirely replaced internal e-mail for us, with something far more powerful - unlike e-mail, the total transparency means there's no lost "organizational memory" when roles change, on top of numerous other benefits. &nbsp;It's definitely&nbsp;required some habit changes to integrate, and not everyone loves it personally, but I love what it's doing for the business regardless -&nbsp;if I were starting another company, it'd be&nbsp;at the top of my list of the most important software to adopt&nbsp;immediately.</p><p>Of course, I've got to&nbsp;mention GlassFrog here as well: aside from holding all of our key governance data, we use Notes on roles &amp; circles to give us a basic intranet / knowledge-management system. &nbsp;Some of those notes hold information directly, and others link to a Google Doc/Sheet or other files in Google Drive;&nbsp;one way or another, much of our&nbsp;important data is linked from GlassFrog, so&nbsp;they're all catalogued by role/circle and more easily findable.</p><p>For video collaboration, we mostly use BlueJeans (it's pretty good, though it does have some issues and it's expensive enough that I doubt it'd make sense for many organizations). &nbsp;One of our teams also&nbsp;uses Google Hangouts quite a bit.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Mike,&nbsp;</p><p>I have used Podio as a platform for Collaboration across continents including CRM and Knowledge Management, even Holacracy although that was clunky but it worked. Glassfrog and HolaSpirit are much better for that purpose. &nbsp;With Podio you can build your own Apps to fits your needs. Think of Podio as Slack + Salesforce + Knowledge Management + Calendar (syncs with Google Calendar although I use prefer iCal as Google is blocked in China) etc... all in one and easy to tailor to a growing Global Networks' evolving needs.&nbsp;</p><p>For Video Collaboration, I use GoToMeeting, HangOut, Zoom, Skype... whatever works best on the day and in the particular location (one of the challenges of poor network in emerging markets and working from behind the Great Firewall of China).</p><p>Best wishes,&nbsp;</p><p>~ Cyrille</p>      </div>

<p>Hello Mike,</p><p>First, you should know that I'm just putting my toe into the Holacracy pond, trying to figure if it is possible to implement as a practice within the framework of a member-based non-profit.&nbsp; I have 2 major roles, an organizational change consultant and the US lead for a member-based global organization.&nbsp;</p><p>My current client (manufacturing) uses O365, sharepoint, Skype for Business&nbsp;and Kronos (they are not a target for Holacracy).&nbsp;My non-profit uses O365, sharepoint, Skype and gotomeeting.&nbsp; My non-profits use drupel for websites because of the member data option but I simply hate it. Very&nbsp;difficult to make edits. I much prefer wordpress. I've started other&nbsp;non-profits where we used Google docs, Salesforce,&nbsp;webex&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft apps.&nbsp; I prefer O365 to google but I believe it is simply familiarity.&nbsp; Currently we are posting role descriptions on&nbsp;O365 sharepoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have to say that I looked at Glassfrog and I definitely see the value and alignment with Holacracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Happy to discuss further.</p><p>Michelle (Detroit, Michigan)</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Mike,</p><p>great question!</p><p>i like pipedrive for CRM. Although I didn't try to make it role based.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft dynamics I have seen completely unable to create anything easy a bit dynamic towards what Holacracy needs. Way too static and complex for changes.&nbsp;</p><p>And ofcourse the GTD like systems eg Todoist, NirvanaHQ, Asana,...</p><p>Anyone a suggestion for a financial suite? That allows for role/project based dynamic budgeting? Or an awesome dashboarding/metric transparency tool?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>We're Google Apps / GlassFrog with a couple team members additionally using Asana and/or Trello.</p><p>I still dream of a full-team task/project integration someday with something like Asana, but frankly I don't think our team is mature enough / responsible enough to handle rigorous organization.</p><p>WHICH also happens to be where Holacracy sometimes breaks down for us - in the follow-through of core duties of circle members/responsibilities of role fillers.</p><p>Oh well, related topic soon to be posed for us re: project tracking.</p>      </div>
