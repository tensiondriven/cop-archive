  <dd>Incomplete Role function doesn't show up when it is a circle.</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Glassfrog allowed async creation of a new role / circle with no purpose, no domains, and no accountabilities. It does not show up as an incomplete role. I approved it as an async because it will be easy to add a purpose, domain, or accountabilities afterward. I just thought it was interesting that there is the "incomplete role" functionality but that it does not apply to circles. [@mention:449833773730792463], I thought you might appreciate knowing about this.</dd>

<p>Tyler, appreciate your feedback about this. &nbsp;Can you share what tensions it is causing&nbsp;when the circle doesn't show up as incomplete? &nbsp;And what kind of indication do you feel would be useful? &nbsp;Such a circle already shows the default roles as unfilled (white), which is some indication of it's new state.</p>      </ul>

<p>I just found it odd / inconsistent that you have incomplete role for roles but not for circles.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:456167666726491228]: yes, that&nbsp;is inconsistent since circles are also roles, and circles probably need at least a purpose more than other roles. Thanks for pointing it out!</p>      </ul>
