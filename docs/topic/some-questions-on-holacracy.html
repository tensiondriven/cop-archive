      <h4>Some questions on Holacracy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all,</p><p>I have the following questions:&nbsp;</p><p>1. &nbsp;When does a Holacracy company know it is time to recruit people? &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;How does a Holacracy company assess the fit between a person&nbsp;and the number of the roles the person took? &nbsp;I noticed attention point system. &nbsp;Does lead link have motivation to use the role taker's most attention? &nbsp;Lead link may assign more points than necessary to secure the role taker's attention in the circle which lead link is associated with.&nbsp;</p><p>3. How does a Holacracy system allocate resources? The resources are limited. In plan and control pattern, company uses budget to manage resource allocation. What is like in a Holacracy company&nbsp;to make use of the resources appropriately? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>4. Compensation is a core issue. &nbsp;Assessing the value of each role sounds difficult because the accountabilities in each role are evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp;Badge-based system sounds workable. &nbsp;Is the badge-based system similar to skill-based system? &nbsp;Could anyone provide some more details? &nbsp;</p><p>5. If a person in a circle propose a tension that he/she feels overloaded, does he/she need to argue why the workload is unreasonable? Is there a mechanism that can assess if his/her proposal can be accepted?&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry for asking so many questions. &nbsp;Those questions were&nbsp;from managers' feedback when I tried to promote Holacracy to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
