  <dd>Time commitment of people joining an organisation</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>we are in a start up phase and people coming are also wanting to see what is it to be with our enterprise so we end up having more of those who are not super committed to the processes and our purpose and our trying understanding it. Any one can say the dangers of working with a team when they are not committed yet for long term. its more like having interns and volunteers. any thoughts on on boarding and whom to hire or what qualities we look for.</dd>
