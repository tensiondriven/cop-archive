  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Two part question stemming from the following tension. A Lead Link is frustrated by the fact that some Roles are not present at tactical meetings to report on metrics, checklists, and project updates. First part of the question: Can a Role-filler designate someone to attend in his/her absence to temporarily fill the Role? I don't see any provision for that in the Constitution, but I feel like I've heard that before. In the case of the Role being a Sub-Circle, the Lead Link/Rep Link are...</dd>

<p>Any core circle member can request another core circle member to attend a specific instance of a recurring meeting to process a tension (that's my reading of 4.1.3). Duty of prioritisation than applies.</p><p>As far as I can see, there's nothing in the constitution to stop you having 'surrogates' for roles (and agreeing how that happens may be useful under other circumstances too - illness, holiday cover etc). In Governance "a Proposal may alternatively help another Circle Member better express one of that personâ€™s Roles in the Circle, but only if that person has granted the Proposer permission to represent that Role" &nbsp;- so my inclination would be to apply the same spirit in Tactical. But you can of course do anything <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

<p>The simple path is for the Lead Link to use the existing prioritization power to say, "attending this meeting is the highest priority among any other work in the circle."&nbsp;</p><p>Then, if someone doesn't show they would need to explain why.&nbsp;</p><p>Often this is enough.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
