      <h4>Resignation from roles</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Following to the constitution (2.4.3) »When you fill a Role, you may resign from the Role at any time, unless you’ve agreed otherwise, by giving notice to whoever controls assignments to that Role – typically, the Circle’s Lead Link.«</p><p>In practice we face the challenge that people who have been hired with the focus of a certain business area (f.e. finance) resign from their main roles to fill other roles in the organization. Sometimes they are asked by other LeadLiknks to fill other roles, sometime it is their active wish to switch to other roles. The LeadLink of the respective circle has again and again to fill the roles with new persons and the circle loses important know-how.&nbsp;</p><p>Which possibilities do we have to agree otherwise and »protect« the role? Do you have similar issues and how do you solve them?</p>    </div>

<p>&gt;Which possibilities do we have to agree otherwise?</p><p>How we handle this at GrantTree is with the following logic: you can always leave the company at any time by giving your contractual notice (generally 4 weeks). If you can do that for all your roles, it seems illogical that you couldn't do that for some of your roles. So our agreement (in the form of a policy) is that you can leave any role by giving 4 weeks notice.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:577070702037707949]. What you can do is use the employee hiring contract. Make people sign that if the start with the Company they are not entitled to drop role XYZ in the first x (pick a number) years of their contract. This is completely in line with article 2.4.3. ...... unless you've agreed otherwise.</p><p>Hope this provides a pathway for you.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:523162737680436711], do you have some kind of language to cover the event that the Role committed to in the contract is removed during a governance meeting before the commitment time is up?</p>      </div>

<p>Geoff. I would not care anymore. If the role no longer exists the contract obligation has no value anymore.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:577070702037707949], if your main tension is knowledge management, beside contract obligation (might be too late), you could consider creating a constraint on the resignation process, maybe to organize knowledge hand over for instance. Check the HolacracyOne <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/6839" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Partnership structure policy</a> as an example.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:449833773917801859], below is a Google Translation of the policy. It reads very well! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p><em>During a role assignment change, the outgoing Associate will remain affected</em> with <em>the "transition" focus. It continues to carry all the responsibilities, rights and duties of the role as before, and must also train the incoming Associate with the pedagogy and time that are necessary for the latter to become autonomous in the role.</em></p><p><em>As soon as the incoming and outgoing Associates consider without objection that the transition is made, that is, the incoming Associate is sufficiently independent not to harm the organization in the exercise of this transition. role, then they inform the First Link which can then activate the change of assignment, that is to say replace the focus "transition" by the focus "support", which means that the incoming Associate acquires</em> the<em>&nbsp;responsibilities, rights and duties of the role, and the outgoing Shareholder acquires the accountability to "coach on demand, respond to solicitations and offer support to the Incoming Associate". Finally, at the request of the incoming Associate, the Premier Link may delete the "support" focus and decommission the Associate leaving the role.</em></p>      </div>
