      <h4>Focus on the organisation's limiting factor (or constraint)</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<div class="">I have a problem with Holocracy.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">A business is a system, and as such it has one or very few constraining elements that limit achieving whatever its goal is.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">Current organisational structures are not good at finding and exploiting the constraining element(s) properly – because management gives every part its target – targets are often in conflict and local departments will optimise themselves … causing damage to the constraining element.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">Holocracy encourages local optimisation that can result in the same problem … the limiting factors capability will suffer.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">So, in a holocracy there must also be a <strong class="">BOSS … the limiting factor</strong> … since everyone must do whatever is necessary to get the most from it. The rule stated this way is nice, but in the detail its not so clear.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">On top of that the limiting factor will (may) ask to be expanded (not the best first step; the first step is to get the most from the limiting factor). What is likely to happen is the limiting factor moves to somewhere else in the organisation … and all the rules and the necessary information to do what is correct change.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">Not that current organisations solve this sort of problem; but I don’t see Holocracy doing it either.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">So how can Theory of Constraints thinking be integrated? The information, the rules, the limits etc. How can they be built to get the most from the organisation as a whole.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">One thing that is obvious – peer pressure in a holocracy will lead to everyone doing their best … work all the time. THAT IS BAD – because only the limiting factor should sometimes work all the time (even it should have some spare capacity to capture new business)</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">I have not read all, I know there is a mechanism to adapt rules etc, but these changes come from a local perspective. They must be considered from the global point of view! By the Boss.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">The idea of Holocracy is seductive, but so far I have not seen that it addresses this key issue.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">(Some might say, ‘We have many constraints’. That is not understanding the (business) system. In any system of interdependent entities there can be only 1 constraint (one weakest link),If an organisation has (seemingly) many, then they are caused either by management policies (Holocracy policies??) or that there is no constraint … there is plenty of capacity. The constraint might be the market …</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">In any case, whatever way of management is applied, the constraint is the governing factor. Either you deal with it correctly or suffer the consequences.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class="">Rudi</div>    </div>
