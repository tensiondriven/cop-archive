      <h4>FACILITATING LEAD LINK PROPOSAL</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Let say that a Lead Link makes a proposal on a existing role (Role A) to modify one of Role A's accountabilities, does the Lead Link has to give an actuel, specific and reasonable exemple situation?</p><p>&nbsp;Because when it comes to Lead Link, it seems easy for them to just answer "I am making this proposal because it is made solely to help evolve the Circle's Governance to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening and because since I have the accountability to <em>Structure the Governance of the Circle to enact its Purpose and Accountabilities</em>, I am sensing that the Role A's accountabilities should be what I propose instead of what it is actually".</p><p>&nbsp;As a facilitator, can I consider this kind of&nbsp;proposal valid?&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of question can I ask to be sure that the Lead Link's proposal is really made to help evolvle the Circle's Governance to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening?</p>    </div>
