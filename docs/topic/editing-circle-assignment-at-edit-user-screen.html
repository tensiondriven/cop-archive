      <h4>Editing Circle Assignment at Edit User screen</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Folks -&nbsp;</p><p>When adding a new user I have the opportunity to 'assign' them to one or more circles (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5XDFZNCMYhXai1rYWFwMzFwVjQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">see screenshot 1</a>) and have assumed this provides them access to circle meeting tools like recording tensions during tactical meetings, be assigned individual action projects in the circle&nbsp;and other items (although can find no documentation about any of that). &nbsp;This for individuals who are to be core circle members but not filling a circle role.</p><p>However, when I want to add an individual that is a user in the system to such an assignment - again not filling a circle role, but able to make use of other circle tools, see above no docu... this ability to assign to circle does not exist (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5XDFZNCMYhXR0JDelBvdVpwc0E/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">screenshot 2</a>).</p><p>Help? &nbsp;Thoughts? &nbsp;Hoping for some GF knowledge here - not getting much luck of late&nbsp;through the zendesk helpers.</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The “add to circle” function means that the person become a circle member of the circle. If you want to add new persons as circle members to a circle, you need to ask the Lead Link of such circle to do it because only the LL can say that someone is a circle member even though this person doesn't fill any role.</p><p>Please find a screenshot to see how to add someone as circle member:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-QiMBgmfuzcajJaZlU3dFlDU3M/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/...U3M/view?usp=sharing</a></p><p>As you will see, a little red star will appear if the person doesn't have any role within the circle.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>Per Margaux's instructions, you can add users to the circle from the circle page (if you are admin, or circle LL or circle secretary). Then you can drag/drop them to the fill the role. You can also just fill them directly into roles from the little +person icon to the right of the role name on the circle page, and they will be added to the circle if they aren't already - you can choose from anyone in the organization.</p><p>There's no current plan to add the ability to mass add&nbsp;a user into multiple circles besides when you add a new user, but as GlassFrog Product Manager, I'm always taking feature ideas, so I'd love to hear if you think something would be useful - I pretty much stalk the GlassFrog forum looking for feature ideas!</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>In GlassFrog, it will give them permissions access like a circle member (e.g. attending tactical meetings, getting notifications, assigning individual action projects, etc).</p><p>Though, from&nbsp;a constitution standpoint, I'm not sure how meaningful it is if they aren't filing a role on the circle - I don't think they are a Circle Member according to the constitution. &nbsp;I could see the use case might be fairly specific, like maybe they are a coach, or LL wants to invite them to circle meetings for some reason, or LL is planning on adding them to a role, but I'd be careful with it because it could add a lack of clarity. That's my thoughts, though, maybe a coach would want to weigh in on the topic.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>Glad I could help! To your point on #3, GlassFrog will&nbsp;let you choose anyone in the org for elections - they don't have to be in the circle. If you are seeing that happen, then it is a bug and I'd love to hear about it!&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>I'll give you a gold frog! You're right, the election code dates back a while, and I think the constraint on electing to only circle members is in 3 or 4, so it was intentional at one point. We try to strike a balance between upholding the constitution, and giving folks flexibility in GlassFrog, so hearing how folks are using the elections is extremely useful for me, thank you! &nbsp;I hadn't thought about policies allowing electing folks outside of the circle, etc. &nbsp;I'll add it to my notes.&nbsp;Regardless, it will probably stay as it is for a while since&nbsp;we've got so many things that I'd like to see in GlassFrog.</p><p>Thanks!</p>      </div>

<p>I do think it is an intentional feature and not a bug - because as Margaux and Frederik concur - only core circle members are eligible for election.</p><p>That's a different thing that assignment to a ROLE, which all system users can be assigned to.</p><p>I get a gold star for the day, I say so myself.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

We have such a policy in place for our facilitators: "In all circles only those people may be elected as Facilitators who are filling the role of Qualified Facilitator. An election of a person as Facilitator who is not filling the role of Qualified Facilitator is invalid and requires a re-election."</p>      </div>

<p>I have heard organizations use this 'feature' I think to elect facilitators who arent core circle members. If the circle doesnt have someone experienced or needs more skilled facilitation early on, you can allow this via policy. It is nice for GlassFrog to not enforce every aspect of the constitution. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>
