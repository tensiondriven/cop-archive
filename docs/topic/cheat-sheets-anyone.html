      <h4>Cheat Sheets anyone?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p class="p1">Hi everyone,</p><p class="p1">while studying the Constitution I sensed the need for a tool that would allow me to recall the many concepts of Holacracy in a more graphical way. Holacracy is filled with concepts that have potential graphical counterparts (Circles, processes, roles, links, and more abstractly: containment, intersection, impact).</p><p class="p1">I started working on a deck for my personal use that would recap the entire Constitution one slide per article (I know that is a lot of compression, forgive me MR Komolgorov...) . The purpose is not to put all the concepts in one place, but to create graphical hooks between a cheat sheet and the chapters of the Constitution adding &nbsp;maybe a sentence or two that would help recalling the concepts.</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Maybe HolacracyOne has already made available something like that as training material &nbsp;(I' haven't attended yet)</p><p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">If anyone has already worked on something similar I’d like to know to avoid duplicating the effort…</p><p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">ciao.</p><p class="p2">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Andrea.</p>    </div>

<p>We are also working on an infographic. It's purely in the pre-making stage at this point.

Maybe my 1 article : 1 slide ratio was a bit too much as far as information compression is concerned.<br /><br /></p><p>I am wondering if the best approach would instead be the opposite:</p><p>- create an infographic that explains Holacracy forgetting about the exact mapping to the Constitution structure, instead each concept could be mapped with a graphical placeholder, when approriate, to the corresponding article that mentions it (duplications allowed: ex: a graphical concept associated with one or more tags that say i.e. [1.2.3][4.5.1][3.4.1] mapping it to the spots in the constitution where that &nbsp;concept is mentioned or addressed.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The approach of the video is great, unfortunately it skips on the hardest part of delving into the detailed concepts that must be recalled (at least for my purpose), by staying at a higher, sort of "marketing level"&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>The idea of a collection of mini infographs sound good. They could be linked in a Prezi format to turn it into a coherent whole. I can probably figure out the Prezi part if someone else wants to apply some design to Chris's sketches...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Yeah, I think just creating a mini infograph for each section makes the most sense....then just trying to tie those smaller sections together, graphically, on a bigger map.
