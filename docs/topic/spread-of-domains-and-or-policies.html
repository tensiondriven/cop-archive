      <h4>Spread of domains and/or policies</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all, this is how I currently explain what the spread or influence of domains and/or policies are throughout the organization. I always thought this was correct, but recently read some other interpretations. So I'd like to check with you guys, are these statements correct?</p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a role or a circle anywhere in the organization has a domain, the domain (and any accompanying policies, if any) applies (or apply) to all roles in all circles of the organization.</span></em></p><p><em><span>If there is a policy in a circle, but the circle does not explicitly has that domain, the policy applies only to all the roles inside the boundaries of that circle (including the roles in all&nbsp;sub-circles&nbsp;of that circle, if any, all the way down).</span></em></p><p><span>Thanks for commenting!</span></p><p><span>Koen</span></p>    </div>

<p>Hey Koen,</p><p>I agree with statement 2 but not statement 1 and I would add a statement 3:</p><p><em>1/ If a role or a circle anywhere in the organization has a domain, the domain (and any accompanying policies, if any) applies (or apply) to all roles in all circles of the organization.</em></p><p>Part of it is false, if a role in a sub-circle has a domain but the circle itself doesn't have that domain (meaning it hasn't been delegated to the circle), then this role owns the domains only in regards to other roles within the circles, not outside the circle (just like policies in statement 2). You can't control what hasn't been delegated to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Statement 3 just for fun: <em>If a circle has a domain that hasn't been delegated to a role within that sub-circle, then the Lead Link of that sub-circle can define policies to constraint/authorize how other roles/circles outside this sub-circle can impact that domain.</em></p><p>Hope I am right.. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I am progressively refining my understanding thanks to these bursts of dialog on the subject, my current understanding follows, but I would not walk on fire &nbsp;to prove that I am right and I urge anyone to jump in and help me reshape my interpretation into the correct one.</p><p>- A&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- B</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + D</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;C</p><p>let's say we have 4 circles (A is the Anchor, A contains B and C, B contains D)</p><p>A Creates a Domain on B &nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;Members of B and D can impact it, Members of A and C cannot (unless: they request permission OR B creates a policy to allow them)</p><p>NOW: B may delegate that domain further down to any of its directly contained roles (including Circle D), when that happens the other members of B won’t be able to impact the domain without permission anymore. (nothing will be changed for members of A and C)</p><p>IF INSTEAD B created the same domain we are talking about on D (but the domain had not&nbsp;previously been delegated to B by A), C would be allowed not to&nbsp;care about it and would be able to act as if the domain didn't even exist.</p><p>Extreme example:&nbsp;</p><p>at day 1 the organization has no domains at all. B creates a domain&nbsp;called "partner hiring process" on D, C can still hire partners in the way it prefers and does not need to care. If However A created the "partner hiring process" domain on B &nbsp;than C would be forced&nbsp;to care about what the domain implies.</p><p>Going back to Koen's&nbsp;rules:</p><p>&nbsp;rule 1: would only be valid if the domain was hierarchically&nbsp;delegated from the top as it is or at least if it was the result of consecutive domain subdivisions in the process of delegation starting from the top down to the circle where the domain lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;rule 2: every policy is defined on a domain, if the domain is not mentioned the policy is considered to be applying to default domain of the circle, which is the "set of all activities and functions of the circle" itself.</p><p>and here is where I add my little doubt to the "domain hell" ;-) It is my understanding (but again please comment)&nbsp;&nbsp;that the default domain is by default "not delegated from above", &nbsp;If it was delegated by default&nbsp;no one would be allowed to enact any accountability of another circle without breaching a domain which contravenes&nbsp;the basic principle of : "go and do what you perceive to be good for the organization until someone complains about it".</p><p>I believe this interpretation to&nbsp;&nbsp;be correct because: <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art211" target="_blank">art 2.1.1</a>&nbsp;seems to limit the way in which a default domain should be considered a domain (see the part in bold)</p><p>"Further, each Circle may control its own functions and activities, as if a Domain of the Circle, <strong>for the purpose of defining Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles."</strong></p><p>My interpretation is that the default domain is not to be considered a full fledged domain.</p><p>What do you guys think?</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>Andrea.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi,</p><p>like this&nbsp;profound&nbsp;conversation about nuances of holarchic principles - thanks for all your perspectives and summaries, very helpful!</p><p>Here's my additional thoughts:</p><blockquote><p><em>Where a domain&nbsp;<strong>HAS</strong>&nbsp;been delegated to a circle/role, from super-circles all the way from the anchor circle, the domain (and any accompanying policies) applies to&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;roles in all circles of the organization.</em></p></blockquote><p class="p2">To my understanding domains and policies are holarchic (and affect all the circles down). Referring to&nbsp;Andrea's point about "the default domain not being considered a full fledged domain" and Nick's example of the Auto-accept time limit I would still interpret&nbsp;a GCC policy relevant for all sub-circles, even without an explicit domain, since it applies&nbsp;to&nbsp;"all activities and functions within the circle".&nbsp;</p><p class="p2">I still have a few practical&nbsp;questions: how can a spread of domain&nbsp;show up&nbsp;in Governance? The domain of circle B is&nbsp;visible at the "super-circle boundary" (ie the LL role representing the circle B in the super-circle A). Since the domain must stay visible at the circle boundary you can only grant authority&nbsp;to impact&nbsp;that domain for subcircles via a policy. And:&nbsp;a policy in Circle B that allows impacting a domain of Circle B for Circle D is&nbsp;delegated further downwards to a Sub-Circle of D via processing a change of the policy in Circle B e.g. via Rep Links. I wonder how transparent and easy to capture that is for circle members of D, since the policy is not part of the subcircle's governance but a few circles up. And how do circle members hold themselves well-informed about changes without screening Glassfrog records every morning. For larger org that can become really tricky.</p><p class="p2">Any thoughts / experiences on that?</p><p class="p2"><em>- Gerald</em></p>      </div>

<p>hi all, if I understand this discussion thread well then the meaning of the word&nbsp;Domain and Policy depend on the context, how it is applied in practice. It reads like there are at least 3 valid applications with each their different meaning/implication on how you use it pragmatically in real life. And hence understanding it is relatively complex.</p><p>What about differentiating the naming? If the concept is too broad then lets come up with easy to understand different names for each of the applications. Eg create a simple definition for the "Global-domain" (which is delegated out of the anchor circle) and the "Local-domain" (only valid within one circle). Sorry for the non creative new names...&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">Just to give an illustration that with differentiated names for simple&nbsp;applications would make the</span> <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">constitution easier&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">support practice. Not even sure if this example is valid/pragmatic, but just to share a thought on how different naming could&nbsp;reduce complexity.</span></p><p>Hope I made a clear point.
