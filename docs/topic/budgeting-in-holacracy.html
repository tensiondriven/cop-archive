  <dd>Budgeting in Holacracy?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We are trying to figure out how to run and manage the budgeting process for individual circles and also how that looks in terms of reporting &amp; budget management overall without it feeling like a hierarchy. We are a non-profit so we have some hierarchical reporting needs to our donors. I would love any advice or to hear of how other organizations using Holacracy are handling this. Many thanks!</dd>
