  <dd>Some of roles in our circle grow into circles themselves. But some sub-circle choose not to use holacracy. We decided that's okay as long as they still have rep link that's elected and join the bigger circle's meetings. What would be the issues of doing this way? Or is it okay to continue ?</dd>
