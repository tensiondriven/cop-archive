  <dd>Is there anyone interested in practicing holding governance meetings and tactical meetings to prepare for the facilitator assessment test? I do have a modified version of Tom Mulder's materials and would love to get together with a coach and others as we hold governance and tactical meetings. Holacracy is one of those things that you can't really know it until you practice it. Is there coaches and practitioners willing come together to help prepare for the facilitator assessment?</dd>
