  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We are working in a 50 people company using Holacracy. We are in the process of adopting LeSS. In LeSS all work is on the product backlog. This is the Focus principle of Scrum . Several developers have other Holacracy roles: to check if we have vulnerable dependencies, to monitor integration tests and report when they get broken and several other such roles. How can we manage work from roles and work from the backlog?</dd>
