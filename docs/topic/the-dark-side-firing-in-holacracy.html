      <h4>The Dark Side: Firing in Holacracy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Dear Practitioners of Holacracy,</p><p>how do you handle Firing with Holacracy? We are currently setting up a process on Hiring and Firing. The Hiring seems to be easy: if the responsible Roles agree and the budget is available go and hire the person. Easy.</p><p>Firing on the other hand seems a bit harder. We don't have any proper process in place and those processes which work in the old world seem a little off in a Holacratic organization. A traditional escalation process might look like this:</p><p>1st step: Verbally requesting certain outcomes (project results, behaviour changes, etc.)<br />2nd step: Verbal and written warning including ultimatum<br />3rd step: Evaluation of situation and termination of contract / dismissal</p><p>It's surely possible to implement such a process in Holacracy but to me it somehow feels wrong; this process doesn't seem very self-organized and it doesn't seem like the future of organizations.</p><p>My general idea is to have some sort of transparent process that can be triggered by any partner of the organization if certain criteria are met. I would like this process to redirect people into a future which could mean exiting the company or reallocating talents elsewhere in the organization. Have you figured out any exemplary processes yet?</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Friedrich,</p><p>Most interesting question.</p><p>From my perspective, you have to :</p><ul><li>design an app&nbsp; describing the firing process,</li><li>then to adopt this "Firing" app through a policy in a gov meeting of the general circle.</li></ul><p>This app has to be designed by a role (HR) accountable for that.</p><p>II've seen a such app once, but I don't find it in the Holacracy Appstore. The main idea was to have a comitee with 3 roles (advocate, lead link, and ?) deciding of firing or not the person.</p><p>One important point - and the first one - from my perspective : firing someone means that that person does not hold any role in the organization. So before this last end, the escalation scenario could be :<br />• taking somebody out of a role (lead link decision)<br />• reallocating the person to another role (lead link decision + reallocating talents process)<br />• if the person does not fit any role, firing process</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>      </div>

<p>Frederik,</p><p>I would say one aspect of Holacracy is that it allows you to separate out organizational fit and termination from just role fit / performance per se.</p><p>A few practices/principles:</p><ul><li>No one person fires</li><li>Clear pathways for assessing a fit for the organization that may or may not result in an exiting from the organization</li><li>Lead Links are not the only input into a termination decision</li><li>Process is transparent</li></ul><p>Step 1: define a role to create the process as a starting point. Then try prototyping something when you have a tension would be my advice. You may need "termination or employment reviewer roles" etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are my thoughts. Would love to see how this shapes up for you all. Please keep sharing!</p><p>Karilen&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Frederick - You can see our approach to firing embedded <a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/6839" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in this policy</a>. &nbsp;And the actual process used in the Partnership Assessment referenced is <a href="https://app.preview.glassfrog.com/policies/7078339" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">documented here</a>.</p><p>Hope that serves as one example of&nbsp;a more Holacracy-compatible approach...</p><p>- Brian</p>      </div>
