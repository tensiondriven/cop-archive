Currently, I have a fellowship of the Open Society Foundations to research on how "solid" NGOs are adapting to a "liquid" world. Or, in other words, how are NGOs reacting and adapting to the multiplicity and pace of information, the empowerment of the individual and the crisis of the state. More about it can be found at <a href="http://www.liquidworld.info" target="_blank">www.liquidworld.info</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/people/lucia-nader" target="_blank">https://www.opensocietyfoundat...g/people/lucia-nader</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would love to meet you (and also someone at the citizen engagement lab - do you have suggestion of whom?) to interview you and know more about your experience with Holacracy. Would you be available next week, either Thursday or Friday? Friday anytime before 6pm would be ideal for me, but I am flexible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you prefer to continue by email, my email address is <a href="mailto:lucia.nader@gmail.com">lucia.nader@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many thanks!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Warmest</p><p>Lucia&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Lucia --</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's great to hear about your fellowship and that you're helping OSF think along these lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also curious to know more about nonprofits in the NYC community who are adopting Holacracy. &nbsp;I'm hoping that the nonprofit sector can keep up with the private sector in this regard. &nbsp;Having worked in/with NYC based nonprofits for 8 years, I'm realizing how these "teal" practices are so very necessary to the serious work that needs to be done to make NYC a better place.</p><p><br />I've been making noise about Holacracy in my organization, but since I'm not top-level, I'm not sure how much success it will have. &nbsp;In the meantime, I'm experimenting in the spaces of influence that I do have, and also within our partnerships and political coalition work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd be very curious to know what you are finding and read your research. &nbsp;Do keep in touch!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Michael</p>      </div>
