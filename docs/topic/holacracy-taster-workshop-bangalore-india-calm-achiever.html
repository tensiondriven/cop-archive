<p>I wish I could go to India. I very much enjoyed India the last time I was there.</p><p>I just got off the phone with a friend from India who is living in California. We both think her cousin in Bangalore should go to your event. What is the cost of the event?</p><p>I'm glad that you and Arif are trying to get events going in India. It seems like India would be a fabulous place for both GTD and Holacracy. Ali, I wanted to also say that I really liked your article "20 Things GTD Is Not (And What It Really Is)".</p><p>Take care and good luck,<br />Pam</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Ali,</p><p>I forwarded the info and both links about your event to Deepak Ramachandran in Bangalore. I also told him why I thought Holacracy was important to things he is working on and forwarded him the link of Brian R talking at Google Talks about Holacracy. That talk is my favorite because the intelligent Google staff asked great questions of Brian. I think it has the best set of Q &amp; A back and forth with Brian of any of the intro talks I have seen about Holacracy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLJRpAKS6E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLJRpAKS6E</a></p><p>Good luck with your event.</p><p>Pam H</p>      </ul>
