  <dd>Fixing inconstitutional roles already in Governance</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello everyone, There was a role created in a governance meeting, with a very suspicious accountability (in terms of self-management): Produce a communication plan with multiplier agents for each stakeholder, defining a target audiience, core communication objectives, communication channels, pieces &amp; support materials, responsibilities , periodicity and deadlines. I am aware that this accountability does not achieve what it is trying to do (as accountabilities do not limit other roles).</dd>
