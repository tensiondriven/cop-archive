  <dd>Progression within a Holacracy-powered org</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi everyone, An org I am working with is specifically wanting to find ways of helping people feel like they are progressing within the business without having the traditional hierarchy in place to 'move up the corporate ladder'. Clearly, Holacracy is great for this because of the role fluidity and potential for creative compensation solutions. I was wondering if anyone has written any blogs or articles about this topic so they can get a real sense of the potential benefits? Thanks!</dd>
