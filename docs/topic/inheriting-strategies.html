      <h4>Inheriting strategies</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I've got a couple of questions re. strategies.</p><p>1. When there are no strategies defined in a subcircle, but there strategies defined in a broader circle, glassfrog shows (when viewing the subcircle) the strategies of the first broader circle that has strategies. It show under 'Current strategies': '(Inherited from &lt;name of the first broader circle where strategies are found&gt;&nbsp;'</p><p>Why does glassfrog do that? I have tried to find a constitutional rule, but can't find it.</p><p>2. When (the Lead Link of) a subcircle defines strategies for the circle, are they _replacing_ or _adding_ to the inherited strategies?<br /><br />My understanding was you are always _adding_ (because of alignment), not replacing: There is (or are) the strategies as defined by one or multiple broader circles that the Lead Link (and all roles within the circle) should align with, _and_ the Lead Link can _add_ strategies to the circle.</p><p>Glassfrog gives me the impression that the strategies defined by a Lead Link for its&nbsp;circle are _replacing_ the strategies of the broader circle, because it doesn't display the inherited strategies when it has one defined for its own.</p><p>3. It is the autonomy of the Lead Link to set strategies for its circle (the broader circle cannot change the strategies of a subcircle) _and_ the must align with the broader circle (at least my interpretation of article 4.1.3 Duty of Prioritization, point c) Circle needs over individual needs.</p><p>Thus, to my understanding, there is a hierarchy of strategy, just like there is a hierarchy of purpose.</p><p>If that's correct, wouldn't it be more logical if glassfrog always shows (in the view of any subcircle) all the 'inherited' strategies of broader&nbsp;circles first and the additions added by the LL of that circle (if any)?</p><p>Your reaction is appreciated!</p><p>Koen</p><p>PS: I'd love to see a similiar 'map' of the 'hierachy of *purpose* when looking at any subcircle</p>    </div>
