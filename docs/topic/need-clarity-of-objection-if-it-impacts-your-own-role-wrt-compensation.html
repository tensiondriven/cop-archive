  <dd>Need clarity of 'objection if it impacts your own role' wrt compensation</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>If the compensation is being decided by a role or in the governance, can some one object to it if they think it's not enough amount for them to get? if yes, what is the role they are objecting in? Can they object in their role as partner or member of the organisation? Any one has had this challenge and have solved it?</dd>
