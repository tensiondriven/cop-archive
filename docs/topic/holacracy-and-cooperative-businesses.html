  <dd>Hi all -- Does anyone &nbsp;know of cooperative businesses using Holacracy? I do a lot of work with worker-owned small businesses in NYC, and I'm curious to know if there if a growing practice community among worker coops. I would also love to do more to introduce the growing number of worker coops we're incubating to Holacracy. Thanks for any help! Cheers, Michael</dd>
