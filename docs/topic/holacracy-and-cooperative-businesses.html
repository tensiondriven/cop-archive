      <h4>Holacracy and Cooperative Businesses</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all --</p><p>Does anyone &nbsp;know of cooperative businesses using Holacracy?<br /><br />I do a lot of work with worker-owned small businesses in NYC, and I'm curious to know if there if a growing practice community among worker coops.</p><p>I would also love to do more to introduce the growing number of worker coops we're incubating to Holacracy.</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p><p>Cheers,<br />Michael</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Michael,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We've implemented Holacracy within Scarabée Biocoop which is a cooperative with 5 stores, 3 restaurants and a snack.

<p>Hi Margaux --</p><p>This is great. &nbsp;I marked it down and saved this article to share with the coop community in NYC.</p><p>Do you happen to know of any others?</p><p>I had heard there was a bakery in the Bay Area, CA that uses it as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Michael</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Michael,</p><p><a href="http://www.MeetBerlage.nl" target="_blank">www.MeetBerlage.nl</a> adopted holacracy a six months ago. They have a collaborative ownership/equity structure. They are based in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Michael,&nbsp;</p><p>Three Stone Hearth does use Holacracy and they've been using Glassfrog as well, but don't know if they've had official support or training. My democratically run nonprofit organization, the <a href="http://www.theselc.org" target="_blank">Sustainable Economies Law Center</a>, uses holacracy as a template for our organization. We're working to create resources for nonprofits to institute more participatory/self-management systems into their workplaces, as well as democratic governance and worker control (as much as is legally possible). All of our internal policies are published online on our website under About Us --&gt; Our Governance at the top of our website.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd be interested to know if there are worker coops in NY that are using holacracy, too!</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>-Ricardo</p>      </div>

<p>Excellent! &nbsp;Thanks, Oliver. &nbsp;That's exactly it. &nbsp;I will reach out to them.</p><p>Thank you too, Koen.</p><p>I will keep an ongoing list. &nbsp;I think this is a fascinating intersection and something that's really ripe right now in the cooperative business world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I wasn't here during the initial conversation. What I have been told is that the traditional hierarchy of work wasn't really working. No one really wanted to be the "boss" per se. The people at SELC(where Ricardo works), turned the founders on to it. For about a 6 mo. to a year, only the worker-owners and 1 circle functioned within Holacracy. Once they felt more comfortable, it got spread to the rest of the company. It's not been an easy road at all, we're still working on it. It's gotten a lot better from where we started though. Initially there was a lot of resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>We're unique, I think, because we actually do production type work(food production) and are using Holacracy in a professional kitchen. I don't know of another place that does that.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>In a traditional kitchen setting, it's the Executive Chef's word that is final say on everything. It took some time for people to own their work and get more comfortable in making decisions that ultimately could affect the whole business.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
