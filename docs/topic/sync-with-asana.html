  <dd>Sync with Asana</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Just starting to use this. When a task gets added to Asana it doesn't get added to the new tasks section which is what I would have expected so until I go through my weekly trawl of all tasks I don't notice that it's there. Is there a setting which would make it part of the new tasks section?</dd>
