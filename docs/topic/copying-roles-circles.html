      <h4>Copying roles/circles</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>hi,</p><p>another brainwave on glassfrog functionality.</p><p>would it be possible to copy existing roles and circles incl their domains/policies?</p><p>i have seen the need for this in a few organizations. Especially when an organization is "project" or "process" based. Examples I have seen include a consultancy, some manufacturers or geographically organized with similar organizations in each geography. Most notably I visited a nursery once which had this need, 50 self-organized locations with similar "operations".</p><p>It would be great to just copy an existing circle and use that as a starting point to evolve and adapt then locally. (vs the work around to just manually copy all roles/accountabilities.</p><p>Koen&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Koen,</p><p>I've been hearing similar examples from other companies. I've got some functionality in the backlog to allow exporting/importing roles and policies from files, which I think might meet the need you are talking about, in addition to some other needs for sharing role and policy templates. Do you think this would meet the need?</p><p>I'll definitely add your idea to the notes -- it's helpful to see what use cases any functionality&nbsp;might solve. Thank you!</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you! That reads like a great solution to get started. Alternative I could imagine is create a copy checkbox at the bottom of a governance proposal (eg next to the "make role a circle" checkbox)</p>      </div>
