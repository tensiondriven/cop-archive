      <h4>Holacracy Constitution Quiz</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Wondering if anybody has come up with any kind of constitution quiz they put together to help get a gauge of what topics people in an organization (especially the quiet ones) are stumbling on. &nbsp;Maybe even help aiding in making a holacracy buddy system.</p>    </div>

<p>We run an internal Holacracy Role Filler training as part of our implementation. It focus's on Articles 1 and 4 of the constitution as I believe they are the most important to expose people filling roles to. The course is a walk through of those sections and some activities exercises as I am also a GTD trainer and coach I of course orientate it towards GTD practice as well with practical examples this I have found really focus's people on there duties and responsibilities as role fillers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think articles 2 and 3 are really learned via the practice and involvement of tactical and governance meetings its not about a deep understand of the rules its about learning the practice within the context of the rules just like monopoly its through playing the game and referring to the rules when a issue arises that we get the best learnings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just my 2 cents</p><p>Stephan</p>      </div>

<p>Yes, I tried to add something and correct a misspelling to no avail - perhaps allow commenting if you don't want to allow anyone to edit?</p>      </div>
