  <dd>Issues for Constitution v5.0</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi Folks - A heads-up: I've&nbsp;started processing my notes into clear "user stories" for desired enhancements to Constitution v5.0 (plus&nbsp;questions to explore, "bugs" to fix, and text/logic refactoring desired). I'm posting these in the issues list  in the Constitution's GitHub repository. &nbsp;You&nbsp;can review and comment on them there,&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;submit your own issues (or, if you're feeling really adventurous, try to implement one of them). &nbsp;I'd love some community...</dd>

<p>I started learning Holacracy in April and adopted on October 1st 2015. I realize that I am new to Holacracy however I believe that I could offer a solid perspective in the issues list in the github repository. &nbsp;Should I feel free to comment there or should I refrain? I guess I would like some clarification on your caveat in the original post.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Tyler - Absolutely, please do feel free to comment there if you think you can help - no need to hold back. &nbsp;Worst-case, someone just ignores a&nbsp;comment&nbsp;if&nbsp;you've&nbsp;got some Holacracy technical knowledge&nbsp;missing or off; best-case,&nbsp;you nail an issue&nbsp;and add lots of value. &nbsp;I'll take that gamble if you will -&nbsp;go for it!</p><p>- Brian</p>      </ul>
