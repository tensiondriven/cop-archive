      <h4>How to decide on the lead link</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>If its a partnership what are the ways the partners come to agreement on who the lead link will be.&nbsp;</p><p>If its a board led organisation, how does the board come to choose lead link? is it by sociocratic election(which according to me is part of holacracy constitution in with some modification) or by majority vote or a combination of election process and consent.&nbsp;</p><p>any thoughts are welcome.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>@BERNARD MARIE CHIQUET,</p><p>thanks for your response. I do see that the ratifiers can create the process and the constitution doesnot say much on it. So left to ratifiers presently.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;As written in the Constitution (Section 5.2.1) "The Ratifiers may appoint an initial Lead Link". If any Lead Link, nothing is said re the decision process to choose/select such Lead Link. So back to your question, it's up to the Ratifiers to define such process, could be an integrative election, a vote,&nbsp; something else. Very often, what I have seen in my experience is as simple as they just choose the same decision process the usually use for other decision as a Partnership or Board.</p><p>It is sometimes weird to select&nbsp;only one Lead Link. One of our clients has a Board with 3 Business Partners who decide together re all important issues of the company. Adopting Holacracy meant for them that they&nbsp;had to select one Lead Link for the GCC when they would have naturally preferred to get 3. I'm confident that version 5 of the Constitution would allow for such an option.</p>      </div>

And leave all LL operational decisions to the IDM process in governance ?&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art522" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.2</a>)</p><p>Therefore,&nbsp;regarding having 3 LL: following the idea of having the anchor circle without LL, what about creating&nbsp;a role with all the Anchor circle Lead Link authorities (inc. <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art524" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.4</a>), and assigning all of the 3 business partners&nbsp;to that role ?</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:491495232183315418]&nbsp;in the case I mentioned, they do have an Anchor circle without a LL&nbsp;(like a Board), and they chose one of the three for being the LL of the General Company Circle (sub-circle of the Anchor one).</p>      </div>
