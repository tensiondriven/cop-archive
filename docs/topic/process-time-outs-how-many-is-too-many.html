  <dd>I am implementing Holacracy at my small organization and other than attending the Practitioner and Coaching Workshops and making sure the whole team has appropriate printed materials, budget is compelling us to go it without as much support as I'd...</dd>

<p>Sounds very normal and expected for the early stage Rebecca, and I think allowing those time outs is a good move (although also being cautious about too many what-ifs is good - though some are fine). &nbsp;Sounds like you're balancing it well, and&nbsp;25% of governance time in time-outs feels about right...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Brian</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Rebecca,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What I also do is half a hour Q&amp;A time after the meetings. Maybe that can helpyou as well.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Rebeca,</p><p>My experience is that it helps in the beginning to use tima outs, so the members can learn the Holacracy &nbsp;"rules".&nbsp;However after a few meetings it can get anoying. We decided after 3-4 meetings to&nbsp;use the check out for feedback on the process. This brings the meeting in a more natural flow and gives opportunity for the members the follow the facilitator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Christel</p>      </ul>

<p>Thank you both!</p><p>Brian, that feeling was indeed what I was looking for as our current process time outs feel useful but I want to wean us eventually.</p><p>Christel, I like very much the idea of using check out for feedback however since there is no cross talk during check out. I think I will try to encourage observations during check out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
