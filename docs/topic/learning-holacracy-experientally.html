  <dd>Learning Holacracy Experientally</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I've managed to learn a lot about Holacracy by reading articles and watching videos, but one of the things that is consistently repeated is that the best way to really understand Holacracy is to practice it. Are there any organizations that I could join so that I can learn the practice of Holacracy through hands on experience?</dd>
