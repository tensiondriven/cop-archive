      <h4>Lead Link Accountability Phrasing</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Holacrats -</p><p>One accountability in particular in default Lead Link role definition is quite insanely worded. Please help.</p><p><strong><em>"Removing constraints within the Circle to the Super-Circle enacting its Purpose and Accountabilities"</em></strong></p><p>The problems here are the prepositions 'within' and 'to' and the pronoun 'its'. They're confused or unreferenced and make my not-so-pretty head spin.</p><p>"Within" is the clearest - I believe referring to the Circle (or if you're a member of the Super-Circle, you can think of it as the Sub-Circle). So 'constraints within' could be rephrased 'blocks/limitations inside the sub-circle'.</p><p>But "to" is weird, because how do constraints inside the sub-circle, those problems going on internally, connect 'to' the Super-Circle? When there's a 'to' the direction goes from the preceding noun to the following&nbsp;noun. So now we're at 'blocks inside the sub-circle towards the super-circle'. Huh?</p><p>To make matter worse, we have 'its' which as a pronoun in this context means 'owned by', and presumably references the most recently stated noun, the super-circle, but I for one find myself asking 'which circle's purpose and accountabilities are being affected negatively?'</p><p>Could this, then, be a rewording?</p><p>"Removing blocks/barriers&nbsp;that occur inside the sub-circle that prevent or limit the super-circle from enacting the super-circle's purpose/accountabilities?"</p><p>Expert interpretation gratefully welcomed.</p>    </div>
