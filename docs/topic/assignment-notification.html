  <dd>assignment notification</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Is there any way to get a notification when a person is assigned to or unassigned from a Role? It would be very useful to us, but it doesn't appear to be supported. I see that there is a notification for changes to Notes on a Role, but not assignment/unassignment.</dd>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:450538002759581166]. &nbsp;I should have been more clear. &nbsp;I'm not trying to get notifications for when I have been assigned or unassigned. &nbsp;I would like to get notifications for when anyone is assigned or unassigned.</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:549059653907130620]&nbsp;I understand your point. Personally, I like the fact that we don't have too many push notifications on GF, it forces to go on the website regularly. I would be curious what are others doing!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:549059653907130620], my organization had a similar&nbsp;need at some point, to create a "Role Market Place" (I don't know if it's the same tension here).</p><p>We initially looked at the API, as I did not find anything in GlassFrog being able to do that (you can subscribe to all circle's meeting minutes, but not assignments).</p><p>We could have developed something (like Zappos did and many others I'm sure), but we finally end-up by creating a policy to post in our internal comm media (yammer) roles without assignment.</p><p>May I ask what's your tension behind you need ?</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks,&nbsp;[@mention:491495232183315418]. &nbsp;We have a Role called Pool Boy whose purpose is "An internal talent pool ideally suited for the roles of the organization." &nbsp;Knowing when (and then determining why) people are being removed from Roles would help Pool Boy enact her purpose.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Geoff,</p><p>Through both GlassFrog or holaSpirit, each person receives a notification as s/he is assigned/unassigned to a role.<br /><br />Regards.</p>      </ul>

<p>You could probably do this via the API&nbsp;[@mention:549059653907130620]&nbsp;?</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks,&nbsp;[@mention:544274267239861666], I had looked at the API, and it definitely looks do-able. &nbsp;However, I was hopeful that there was something built in that I just wasn't seeing.</p>      </ul>
