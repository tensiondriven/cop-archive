      <h4>EMPAUA's recruiting policy Dec2016</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I just wanted to share our current recruiting policy/app with everyone. EMPAUA is a european Salesforce consultancy with 40 employees.</p><p><em>This policy defines the recruitment process of all new partners within the organization. It is set out to align with teal principles and practices. General remarks:</em></p><p><em>New partners are thought to be recruited by the following proportions: 60% cultural fit, 30% functional skills and 10% role fit. Recruitment process:</em></p><p><em>1) Tension: Partner is raising a tension about missing PAUA in his circle.</em></p><p><em>2) Focus Meeting: Members: Partner with tension + Recruiter + Finance (GCC) + Lead Link of Circle of missing PAUA Goal: set next actions to solve tension of partner</em></p><p><em>3) First check by Recruiter</em></p><p><em>4) Teal Mail (Template + attachments in Salesforce)</em></p><p><em>5) Building Recruiting Panel by Recruiter<br /> a) Peer<br /> b) Visionary (Senior PAUA-Ranger)<br /> c) Recruiter</em></p><p><em>6) Discovery day (planned by Recruiter):<br /> a) Candidate will work with us for a few hours and speak to the Panel<br /> b) Every Partner gets the opportunity to meet the candidate + can give advice to Recruiter / Panel</em></p><p><em>7) Salary proposal:<br /> a) If references to a similar role are available internally, the Recruiter will give the candidate several real salaries of other partners holding similar positions and will ask the candidate to make a proposal for a salary<br /> b) When references to a similar role are not available, the Recruiter will gather data about the market value of the potential candidate and will offer the highest amount they would pay the candidate.</em></p><p><em>8) Feedback:<br /> a) Panel gives feedback (cultural fit, functional fit, role fit, salary fit)<br /> b) Finance (GCC) gives feedback only on salary fit<br /> c) Recruiter shares feedback with the candidate and he/she can adapt and clarify.<br /> d) Recruiter shares feedback and salary proposal with rest of the team to make the process transparent</em></p><p><em>9) Objection round (only panel and role of Finance (GCC)). Every objection is valid. Objections are resolved through IDM (integrative decision making).</em></p><p><em>10) Offer and Contract</em></p><p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p><p>Best,<br />Max</p>    </div>
