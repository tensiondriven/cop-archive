  <dd>Combining tensions with clarifications in a governance proposal</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Is it constitutionally valid for a tension-driven proposal to also include aspects that are only clarifying? As Facilitator I am testing the tension-driven parts, and accepting the clarifying portions as valid without testing. In contrast, if there are two tensions being separately addressed by different aspects of a single proposal, I insist that they are split into different proposals. If this is not constitutionally valid, then I plan to propose a GCC policy to make this ok. Unless of...</dd>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>I don't understand your issue very clearly.</p><p>From my perspective, important point is to get a starting proposal, even a few words, to process the tension. So you can apply the IDM process. Through clarifying questions and reactions round, proposer will be able to get a lot of informations about his/her original issue. After that, he/her might clarify tension and amend proposal, or drop the proposal waiting for more maturation.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p>      </ul>

<p>When initially testing the proposal as Facilitator, the proposer said it was only clarifying existing activity or governance. Upon further investigation, I uncovered that part of the proposal was actually a tension driven change.</p><p>Example of a clarifying change within this proposal:&nbsp;Creating player spreadsheets <del>(deadline,</del><ins>(except</ins> <del>release,</del><ins>for</ins> <del>che</del><del>cking</del><ins>Client</ins> <del>copies)</del><ins>Services emails)</ins></p><p>Example of a tension-driven change - adding accountability:&nbsp;Deciding how to handle response corner cases when there isn't a standard protocol</p><p>Am I required to have the proposer separate these as different tensions/proposals?
