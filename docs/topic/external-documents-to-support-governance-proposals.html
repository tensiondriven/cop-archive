  <dd>External documents to support Governance Proposals</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I was recently part of a Governance meeting, where a Proposer brought up a slideshow to support his Proposal. He did so in the 'Present Proposal' round. People instantly started to frown because they were afraid it would take a lot of time, but technically I didn't see reason to object to this: the constitution does not prescribe any format for presenting a proposal. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar 'presentations'. The challenge is that such presentations may diverge...</dd>

<p>Depending on time available for the meeting and other tensions identified for processing, the facilitator can kindly ask presenter to schedule an off-line meeting to go over the details of the&nbsp;presentation. With that necessary context built, the next Tactical/Governance meeting could process the tension more quickly.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>From my perspective, bringing up a slideshow to support a Proposal sounds like the proposer want to "sell" her/his proposal and argue about it.</p><p>Even if there is any explicit rule about the way of presenting proposal, using an external document is really strange and useless regarding the IDM process:</p><ul><li>Making a proposal is just completing the sentence "I propose that...‚Äù</li><li>Clarifying questions is the relevant place for other circle members to better understand the proposer's proposal,</li><li>During reaction round, any one is able to react freely to the proposal,</li><li>The proposer is able to amend and clarify her/his proposal,</li><li>Any proposal is supposed valid except if it will harm the circle or it is against the constitution,</li><li>Valid objection(s) will be integrated during the integration step.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seems it might be some shadow power acting behind this behavior...</p><p>Personally I wouldn't allow this way of presenting the proposal and I'd give some coaching point to bring the proposer back into the process.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
