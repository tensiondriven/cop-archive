      <h4>External documents to support Governance Proposals</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I was recently part of a Governance meeting, where a Proposer brought up a slideshow to support his Proposal. He did so in the 'Present Proposal' round.</p><p>People instantly started to frown because they were afraid it would take a lot of time, but technically I didn't see reason to object to this: the constitution does not prescribe any format for presenting a proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone has experienced similar 'presentations'. The challenge is that such presentations may diverge considerably, whereas discussing the proposal in GlassFrog keeps it quite focussed. Wonder how you dealt with this!&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Depending on time available for the meeting and other tensions identified for processing, the facilitator can kindly ask presenter to schedule an off-line meeting to go over the details of the&nbsp;presentation. With that necessary context built, the next Tactical/Governance meeting could process the tension more quickly.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>From my perspective, bringing up a slideshow to support a Proposal sounds like the proposer want to "sell" her/his proposal and argue about it.</p><p>Even if there is any explicit rule about the way of presenting proposal, using an external document is really strange and useless regarding the IDM process:</p><ul><li>Making a proposal is just completing the sentence "I propose that...”</li><li>Clarifying questions is the relevant place for other circle members to better understand the proposer's proposal,</li><li>During reaction round, any one is able to react freely to the proposal,</li><li>The proposer is able to amend and clarify her/his proposal,</li><li>Any proposal is supposed valid except if it will harm the circle or it is against the constitution,</li><li>Valid objection(s) will be integrated during the integration step.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seems it might be some shadow power acting behind this behavior...</p><p>Personally I wouldn't allow this way of presenting the proposal and I'd give some coaching point to bring the proposer back into the process.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
