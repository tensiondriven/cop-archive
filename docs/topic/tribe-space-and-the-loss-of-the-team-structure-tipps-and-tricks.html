Yes, that's the way we did it. We are a big Unit (120 employees) embedded in a huge hierarchical Company. Before we implemented Holacracy we had a big Reorg which brought a lot of different Teams together. Now that we are organized in circles, it isn't easy for us to say where our social home is. We recognize that we need to work on our social space, but it seems to have little references about this topic, as Holacracy doesn't rule this fields (Individual or tribe Space). The issue is bigger for us, as we are working mostly as virtual teams, and we are physically distributed in about 5 branch offices. I was hoping for approaches, which did already help or work in your own circles to build a strong and healthy social bond. Thank you for your reply and best regards!&nbsp;</p><p>Eliana&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:551030431173357846]. great tension. my suggestion: organize it! if you feel a loss of home - why dont you create a circle called "home". could even create different rooms in that home if you have sub-cultures that want to hang out together.</p><p>the "work" you do in those circles is "creating a great place to work", "improving the social cohesion in the company".&nbsp;that kind of things.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

It is really a very good idea to include some team-building activities into our Skype-Tactical Sessions! =) Thank you!! Do you have a favourite team building activity which the people did like the most?&nbsp;</p>      </div>

I did indeed! We already have the role "Social companion" wich looks after strong social bounds and support our people by any kind of personal or social issue. Sadly the colleages are not really reacting to us, nobody come to ask for help, but we still hear that they are missing support. As we are mostly virtual teams I don't really have the chance to organize a lot of events. I have tried to push the slack use, to invite to interact&nbsp;more and get to know each other better, but nobody has enough time (or interest?!) to use all the plattforms we already have, so it didn't really change a lot. In our last employee-survey the deteriorating social/ human dimension since the implementation of holacracy was one of the biggest problems, having a great influence in the average happiness rates, so I still keep looking after some good ideas how to push the social interaction beyond tactical and governance structures... if you have any concrete idea, I'm all ears =) Best regards!

<p>[@mention:551030431173357846]&nbsp;Out of curiosity, did you get professional help to implement Holacracy? In my experience, less experienced Holacracy&nbsp;coaches can tend to hold to the process rigidly in a way that feels overly controlling, especially in tactical meetings. Experienced coaches (or experienced teams) are able to hold to the process of tactical meetings while still allowing people to be themselves and have fun talking about the work.</p><p>If you're very new to Holacracy, then what you describe is a fairly common occurrence&nbsp;in the first month or two. But it should normalize once people get&nbsp;familiar with the process.</p><p>If people really need to talk about social things or about their lives at a personal level, then indeed it would be better done outside of a tactical meeting. But if people miss the "fun" and "playfulness" they used to have in meetings while talking shop, then definitely there is room for that in the tactical meeting. If that's what you're missing,&nbsp;I would suggest finding ways to improve your tactical meeting practice.</p><p>Governance meetings are a different story — they offer little room for spontaneous fun. But they're also not that frequent.</p><p>Hope that helps</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:551030431173357846] we are around 100+ employees, mostly virtual, and geographically dispersed. One practice a few of our circles have adapted is a policy in the Tactical Meeting Check-in to discuss "Personal and Business Bests" with cross-talk allowed. This seems to work well -- partners can talk about their week, business highlights, their weekend, or other fun activities. This also warms up the meeting. Others can comment and ask questions.</p><p>The only downside is it can add time to the meeting and potentially take away time to process tensions. In one circle, we limited it to 30 seconds (not really timed), but just so someone doesn't go on and on forever and we can get to the real reason we're having the meeting.</p>      </div>

<p>What about inviting anyone who wants to talk about <em>how Holacracy in your organization,could be reducing happiness rates</em> .. keeping groups small or large, whatever it takes to make people comfortable about talking about what's behind this. It could be that people are just not comfortable with the clarity Holacracy enables? Holacracy can often be a scapegoat in company as well, for all problems. So getting to the individual "tensions" that exist is so important, for the case for continued Holacracy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi. I don't know if this will help @Eliana but it may help someone else. Eliana said that people in her organization didn't really have or want to spend the time getting to know one another. However, she had asked David if he had a favorite team building activity. I have quite a lot of experience team-building. Getting-to-know-you type games are often called "icebreakers" in the team-building world. A good website of free icebreaker activities is <a href="https://www.icebreakers.ws/" target="_blank">https://www.icebreakers.ws/</a> and you can also just search for icebreakers on the internet.</p><p>I hope that helps.</p><p>P</p>      </div>
