      <h4>Can a super circle Lead Link require that a sub circle Lead Link remove a subcircle within that subcircle?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Can a super circle Lead Link require that a sub circle Lead Link remove a sub circle within that sub circle?</p><p>My thinking is&nbsp; as follows:</p><p>1. This can be requested by the super circle Lead Link and the sub circle Lead Link would have to consider the request.</p><p>2. The super circle Lead Link cannot demand the sub circle Lead Link to remove a sub circle within the sub circle.</p><p>3.&nbsp; The super circle Lead Link could propose governance that removes the entire sub circle (including sub circles in the sub circle) and then re-create the sub circle without the sub circle that they wish to get rid of. (This one feels like a stretch to me but still technically possible right??)</p><p>Any thoughts/comments very welcome,</p><p>Thanks!</p>    </div>

<p>I agree with your thinking Sally (and I would say that as you trained me!) and I think 'no' would answer it for me. As others have noted proposing governance to remove the role (sub-circle) sounds questionable. I wonder how this proposal would '<span class="fontstyle0">resolve or reduce a Tension sensed by the Proposer' or 'help the Proposer better express the Purpose or an Accountability of one of the Proposer’s Roles in the Circle'?</span></p>      </div>

<p>It seems to me that a lot of coaching opportunity is available here for the super circle Lead Link and others. That individual seems to be thinking as a manager or department head, and that they control what happens 'below' them.</p><p>That's not Holacracy.</p><p>What actual live need (tension) does that person perceive? Is there a problem or a lack that the existence of that sub-sub-circle creates?&nbsp;</p><p>Is that sub-sub-circle functioning? Look at&nbsp;meeting record, ask Facilitator to audit. If it's an empty shell then maybe there is a process breakdown and Facilitator can intervene to restore process.</p><p>In the course of our effort we have at time created sub-circles out of imagineered design rather than real tension, then they withered due to inactivity and were collapsed.</p><p>But like Brian said, that LL has no say in how the sub-circle is structured (with or without additional sub-circles) as long as it is fulfilling its purpose &amp; accountabilities.</p>      </div>

<p>If the Lead Link of the super circle wants to do this, it almost definitely indicates something is off - the super circle lead link shouldn't need to know or care how the sub-circle is structured, as long as it fulfills its purpose and accountabilities effectively, within any policy constraints of the super circle.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;whether it's allowed or not is likely a distraction (and no, it's not really allowed) - the real question here is why that lead link feels the need to do it, and the opportunity is to help them figure out what they really need the sub-circle to&nbsp;do (e.g. what accountability) such that they wouldn't care how the sub-circle organizes to do it...</p>      </div>

<p>I've found that most engineered solutions to circle structure (read: not based in an articulated tension) cause one or more of the following:<br />- people realize that it's not Holacracy for all, and it's demeaning...the person at the top is still just making decisions based on an old leadership paradigm</p><p>- the circle is less effective b/c the fiction of the creation becomes clear as they try to live out the purpose. Incongruencies abound and it's harder to get aligned on the work.</p><p>Convincing the people at the top of the food chain to work from a tension (firm on the tension and loose on the proposal) instills confidence throughout the company.</p><p>The short answer, is they can do anything they want but there is a cost to it.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
