      <h4>Strategy Definition in Holacracy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello - I have a role to facilitate strategy creation and use at our company. &nbsp;I'm trying to get more clarity&nbsp;on the definition of a strategy related to Lead Link accountability.</p><p>We're having a debate about whether a Strategy can only be a heuristic (for guiding roles in their own decisions) and definitive tangle outcome, initiative or program.</p><p>It felt clear to me in 2.2.2 below that the constitution, for purposes of the Lead Link, is defining "Strategy" as "heuristics that guide", and would preclude stating a specific outcome. &nbsp;This is how we initially created our strategies with a workshop run by H1 about 1.5 years ago. &nbsp;The definition of Heuristic (enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves) also seems to support this.</p><p>That said, others here believe the language is not meant to be taken so literally (which then generates all kinds of questions about the constitution on lots of topics). &nbsp;They also have looked to H1's strategies in Glassfrog where some in the past&nbsp;have&nbsp;appeared to state specific outcomes and not just heuristics. &nbsp;(although I don't see any there today).</p><p>Thoughts? &nbsp;Thanks, Scott</p><p><u><strong>2.2.2</strong></u> <u><strong>DEFINES PRIORITIES &amp; STRATEGIES<br /></strong></u>◦A Circle’s Lead Link may <u><strong>define relative priorities</strong></u> for the Circle.&nbsp;<br />◦In addition, the Lead Link may define a <u><strong>more general “Strategy”</strong></u> for the Circle, or multiple Strategies, <u><strong>which are heuristics that guide</strong></u> the Circle’s Roles in <u><strong>self-identifying priorities</strong></u> on an ongoing basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
