  <dd>Looking for Holacracy Practitioners in USA</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I am shammi nanda from india. I would be visiting New York to attend a Holacracy training with Holacracy One from 16th to 20th April 2018. After that I would like to visit organisations/businesses working with Holacracy. In case any one here is from US and is practicing Holacracy, and is open to have me visit them and learn with them for a few days(for about a week), please let me know. You can also write to me at shamminanda@gmail.com If you are also aware of such organisations/businesses,...</dd>

<p>Shammi, I will also be in New York for Holacracy Training in April on the same dates. My organization Purely Poultry has been powered by Holacracy for 2.5 years. My team is all remote and we work from our homes in Wisconsin. I do not believe that you coming to Wisconsin would be very beneficial but I am looking forward to spending some time with you while we are in New York.&nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/1184" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/1184</a></p>      </ul>

<p>Are there any Holacratic organizations in NY, NJ, CT, MA, or VT that would allow someone to observe. The closer to eastern NY ~1 hr above NYC, the better because the shorter the drive. Thanks so much.</p><p>(I'm trying to study holac organizations to learn the differences between ones that use volunteers and ones that only have paid employees.) I would love to attend the NYC training but it is not accessible to our budget yet.</p><p>Take care, P</p>      </ul>
