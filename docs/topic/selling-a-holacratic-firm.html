<p>Hi Rick,&nbsp;</p><p>My uncle has a Private Equity firm. I talked with him about Holacracy a couple of times. I learned two things:</p><p><strong>1. On company valuation:</strong> His perspective is that in SME firms&nbsp;his valuation depends a lot on the dependency on the&nbsp;founder/director. eg how good will the organization perform if the founder/director leaves after the sale? A high dependency means for him a lower valuation.</p><p>Holacracy is a way to make this dependency explicit. and it also makes the dependency less risky. with a role based structure in case the founder/director leaves it can adapt its structure and do transitions role by role - instead of needing to find a copy-cat of the founder to keep the organization running.</p><p><strong>2. on investor-company dialogue:</strong> Additionally as investor it is sometimes hard to get good information about performance beyond the yearly report and the monthly "meeting room" conversation with the director. A fully transparent way of working helps to make the investor-company relation much more productive.</p><p>its just a story. I dont have an actual case.</p><p>I know that Springest here in the Netherlands just finished an investment round. No idea how running Holacracy played a role in that.</p>      </div>
