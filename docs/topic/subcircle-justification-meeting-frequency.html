      <h4>Subcircle justification: Meeting? Frequency?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Howdy Humans -</p><p>Super-fun Governance meeting just now brought up a very good group of questions around how/if/when a Role is justified to be a Circle? &nbsp;Or when an inactive Circle is justified to be collapsed.</p><p>As part of our first-ever anchor-circle-facilitator governance audit I identified 5 subcircles that had never met and proposed to collapse them, retaining all of the roles and bringing into anchor circles the subroles.</p><p>I bet many of you read this with a sense of perverse joy imagining the pain that I experienced - especially those of you who've met me in person. &nbsp;Oh, the karmic comeuppance.</p><p>So we process timed-out a couple times and I chose to suspect my proposal while we went into informal space. &nbsp;Even that was nice and fun.</p><p>So - hopefully you're done laughing by now - and can offer - how/where/is there any threshold that identifies -&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When a sub-circle is in process breakdown or otherwise can be considered defunct? Perhaps it's if there is no elected Facilitator, Rep Link, or Secretary?</li><li>'what if the circle just met once?' 'would that satisfy the requirement?' 'where is the requirement that we meet, anyway?'</li></ul><p>And everything else I can't think of asking.</p>    </div>
