<p>There is also the possibility of getting some of the materials we (H1) use during the Taster workshops.

Will start thinking how this can be set up. Guess there needs to be some</span></span><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">kind of reference so real tensions start to occur between different roles. As people can create their own role their might be no Governance tensions between roles.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Short idea that crossed my mind is to make the practice even bigger. Why only start with Facilitating practice as this also provides the opportunity to start up Circles. You can then both practice Governance and Tactical meetings.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">You can then start with:</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 72px; text-indent: -18pt;"><span style="margin: 0px; font-family: 'Courier New';"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000;">o</span><span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman'; margin: 0px; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span> <span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Pick a company everyone knows and can relate to.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Then just start. All select a role on the highest level (e.g. Sales, Finance, Marketing etc.) and start from there.

This will make up for new Circles of which the participants then can do Governance meetings;</span></span></li><li style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Create three tensions from your role that you want to propose in Tactical Meeting;</span></span></li><li style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Define a tension that will impact the role of somebody else;</span></span></li><li style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Define a domain that you want to add to one of your roles and process it in Governance;</span></span></li><li style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Ongoing: sense tensions that arise based on actual happenings.

My idea is to have a tutorial game with different levels. So novice level will learn Holacracy via questions or small assignments and for more experienced Practitioners you can make the questionnaire more Constitution related or on Coaching skills.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Let us&nbsp;keep sharing our thoughts.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"><em>Off course&nbsp;I also invite others to share their thoughts so we grow this togehter.</em></span></span></strong></p>      </div>

<p>This thread and the one concerning Gamification should unite.. .</p><p>While I like the idea of a game for training, why not set up a circle in the existing or emerging organization that agrees to run holacracy and learn in real time. There's something about the game that avoids realtime commitment and I wonder what the tension is that's really driving this conversation. .. if I were cynical, I'd say just install it in a circle and avoid creating a product that stands between no holacracy and bringing the value of holacracy into the organization. On the other hand, the entrepreneur in me wished I had thought of the idea for creating a product that helps bridge the skeptics from status quo to status go.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I do agree that elements from this thread and <a href="/topic/gamifying-glassfrog" target="_blank">this one on gamifying Holacracy</a> could definitely merge, but I believe there’s one primary distinction – in my case at least – which is the difference in <em>target group</em>.</p><p>[@mention:523162737680436711],&nbsp;please correct me if I’m wrong, you are thinking of training materials for partners that have gone through some training or reading on Holacracy beforehand and want to keep up what they have learned by utilizing “an&nbsp;online group of [Holacracy] Practitioners that will practice together the skills of Facilitating,” for example by running “scenarios like the Hygean one we had in the PCT.”</p><p>To&nbsp;[@mention:477139080146610445]’s point, in the above case, where practitioners have some experience of Holacracy, I agree with&nbsp;[@mention:455886150941203371]&nbsp;regarding there are pros/cons of doing either an abstract simulation or using existing practice at own organization – with the latter being&nbsp;Holacracy implementation, I believe?</p><p>My situation is a bit different. The current target group I’m aiming for are public guests visiting a 7-day graduation exhibit in April 2017&nbsp;that&nbsp;have no clue or experience of what Holacracy is or could mean for them. So, by having them sign up for initial preset roles at a fictional, virtual organization via a multi-user web platform they will learn the basics of the Holacracy framework by engaging in&nbsp;a role-playing game experience.</p><p>Therefore, in my case, I believe I would go for&nbsp;[@mention:455886150941203371]’s notion, the&nbsp;“nice thing about a simulation is that people can at least get a sense of the structure/rules without the potential distraction of it being contentious/emotional stuff,” recognizing all the while that it is critical for participants to engage actively with their fictional role in order to authentically sense tensions.</p><p>Hence, I believe, it is important for the simulations to include operational work for tensions to naturally&nbsp;surface that then can be processed in tactical/governance meetings – i.e. frame the fictional organization within the <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HIW-Tensions-Drive-Everything-web.svg" target="_blank">Holacracy feedback-loop</a> of sensing tensions based on “stuff coming in” and then doing something about them using the processes.</p><p>I’m currently experimenting with various themes of organizations by initially structuring known ones&nbsp;within a Holacracy structure. For example, the “Pandemic” board game anchor circle and its contained roles might be something like this:</p><ul><li>Anchor Circle (no Lead Link)<br />— Purpose: “To develop cures and prevent disease outbreaks, before four diseases contaminate humanity”<br />— Accountabilities: Doing total of 4 actions&nbsp;(moving from city to city / curing diseases by removing disease cubes / sharing knowledge / build a research station / discover cures&nbsp;/&nbsp;using special role-sensitive accountabilities</li><li>Dispatcher<br />— Purpose:<br />— Accountabilities: Moving other roles (with their consent)&nbsp;to cities containing other roles; Moving other roles (with their consent) from city to city as if were own<br />— Domains:</li><li>Scientist<br />— Purpose<br />— Accountabilities: Needing only four city cards of same color to Discover Cure<br />Domains:</li><li>Researcher<br />— Purpose<br />— Accountabilities:&nbsp;Doing Share Knowledge *to* another role without having the city card match location, on either turn<br />Domains:</li><li>Medical<br />— Purpose<br />— Accountabilities:&nbsp;Removing all Disease cubes of same color in single action; Preventing and removing cured&nbsp;disease cubes simply by being in affected location<br />Domains:</li><li>Generalist<br />— Purpose<br />— Accountabilities:&nbsp;Taking five actions per turn<br />Domains:</li><li>[Facilitator]</li><li>[Secretary]</li></ul><p><br />The above might be too shoehorn-y for I would need to implement the rules of the board game and tweak them to include governance and tactical meetings. It might be easier to develop a fictional&nbsp;organization with its own&nbsp;operational work&nbsp;to let tensions surface.</p><p>Lastly, I’m keenly aware of my bias&nbsp;and assumptions that a simulation of&nbsp;a desk-job context would not be&nbsp;fantastical enough for Holacracy-oblivious users to engage in their own time outside of the exhibit. What do you guys think?</p>      </div>

<p>Chris, I’m so excited to see so many Pandemic players around!</p><p>On the topic of trying to mirror Holacracy’s need for role alignment by&nbsp;utilizing&nbsp;transparent, visual management (checklists, projects, metrics)&nbsp;to when&nbsp;playing Pandemic, the following data is transparent and for all to see at all times <em>in real-time</em>&nbsp;…</p><ul><li>Status of Cured / Eradicated&nbsp;Cures</li><li>Infection Rate</li><li>Players’ Cards (City Cards; Color, Name, etc)</li><li>Amount, Color and Placement of Various Disease Cubes on the World Map</li><li>Placement and Amount of Research Stations on the World Map</li><li>Player deck and discards</li><li>Infection deck and discards</li></ul><p><br />The difference, I think, might be&nbsp;that all of the players’ actions (moving, sharing knowledge, curing diseases, discovering diseases, infecting cities by revealing cards from infection decks (= stuff comes in?)) and the above data is not individually&nbsp;reported back to the group (à la Tactical Meetings), but is instead collectively reported in real time with everything transparent for all to see.</p><p>Do you know what I mean?</p><p>Hard to explain this, but when playing this kind of a board game, you are effectively in a mix of “Doing work in clear roles” <em>and</em> doing “Tactical Meetings and triaging next actions”.</p>      </div>
