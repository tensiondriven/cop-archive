  <dd>Creating a governance agenda item in a tactical meeting</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>If a circle member has a tactical tension in a tactical meeting and identifies that their resolution is to capture a Governance Item, is there any scenario where that item is captured and assigned to another individual in the circle? We have circle members capture their own outputs (rather than the Secretary). I presume the ability to select the individual when capturing a future Governance Item is when someone other than the tension-holder is capturing a Governance Item on their behalf.</dd>
