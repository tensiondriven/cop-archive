<div class="quoteHeading">Thank you for your feedback, Rebecca! Yes, it could get complicated with all the posts and threads all in one forum. At the moment we aren't able to modify or expand the search feature. As the general forum expands and evolves we will create focused forums and consolidate posts/threads in them. &nbsp;The tags are also a tool that can be used by a Member to add specific tags relevant to the content in their posts. &nbsp;</div><div class="quoteHeading">&nbsp;</div><div class="quoteHeading">Originally Posted by Rebecca Brover:</div><div class="quotedText">I'd like to request a more robust search feature on the new CoP.

<p>Hi Rebecca, a new Forum on <a href="/forum/tips-on-using-the-forums" target="_blank">navigation tips</a> is now available. There are a few posts on <a href="/topic/search-functions-1" target="_blank">searching</a>, I hope this answers your request, &nbsp;rather robust for searching at the Advanced level.</p>      </ul>
