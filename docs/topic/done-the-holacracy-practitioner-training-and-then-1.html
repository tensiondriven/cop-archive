<p>Good question. Some of us are lucky and will be practicing Holacracy in their own company. Great way to follow up on the learnings from the HPT.</p><p>But what if you are not having this opportunity? How do you keep the rhythm going? How do make sure all that knowledge is not draining down?</p><p>Join the Online Practice Group. Every week, on multiple times, people are practicing Holacracy Governance meetings. This are people who are preparing for the Assessment but also people who like to maintain their Governance facilitation skills.&nbsp;</p><p>We practice, share insights, provide tips and help each other to become better facilitators. Also we have coaches signing up to provide useful feedback.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href="/topic/online-practice-group-follow-up-s-and-basics?page=1">Conrad's blog</a>&nbsp;you can read more about his experiences during the sessions.</p><p>How to join. Sent an e-mail to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mulder.tom@live.nl">mulder.tom@live.nl</a>&nbsp;and you will receive an invite with access to the Scheduler and the Rules. Currently we have meetings on:</p><ul><li>Tuesday evening from CET 19.30 – 21.30</li><li>Friday morning from CET 09.00 – 11.00.</li><li>If needed/wanted we can expand the time frames available.</li></ul><p>How does it work? We have a scheduler in which you can reserve a spot. Via Skype the group connects and simulate a Governance meeting with the use of GlassFrog. If you just want to observe and want to learn from others. No problem, join and take an observer spot.&nbsp;</p><p>How to get in. Like this topic and sent an e-mail to&nbsp;<a>mulder.tom@live.nl</a>. I will then sent you an invite that grants access to the Scheduler. In the Scheduler you will find the rules for the role play.</p>    </div>
