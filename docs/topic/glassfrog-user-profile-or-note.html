      <h4>GlassFrog User 'Profile' or 'Note'?</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hey Folks, something I know our team could really use is a little paragraph text area inside GlassFrog user display where soul lists roles, for the use to insert a few basic articles of availability, contact preferences etc.</p><p>Many teams may not need that if they're in the same building or have uniformity of working hours, communication streams, etc.</p><p>Our all-virtual/remote team, however is compiled of employees, volunteers and a couple contractors. We have widely variable technical skills,&nbsp;communication platforms, office hours, you name it.</p><p>If there were even an 'about me' type of space at the people/xxx page - see mine below - I could ask our humans to insert communication preferences and availabilities - or do so for them as our account admin?</p><p><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/people/12230" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/people/12230</a></p><p>Oh - I do notice 'tag' in there but have no idea what that is or how to harness it?</p>    </div>

<p>Hi [@mention:454478741268114544],<br /><br />Thanks for sharing this.</p><p>Tags are indeed something that could convey the information contained in a "about me" section. Note that tags are only available for Premium accounts though.</p><p>In a nutshell, tags are labels that are associated to people and that can help keep track of all kind of things, you're the one creating the labels.<br />Here is more details about how to create tags and utilize them:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.glassfrog.com/support/solutions/articles/9000134248-how-do-i-tag-a-person-in-glassfrog-premium-" target="_blank">https://support.glassfrog.com/...n-glassfrog-premium-</a><br /><br />I hope this is helpful.<br /><br />Audrey (as GlassFrog Customer Support)</p>      </div>

<p>Hmm well thanks for the response, Audrey, but I've been experimenting with tag since your suggestion and it is quite a bit different from a simple text area. This should not be a very difficult development item.</p><p>Would you kindly push it to feature request role(s)?</p><p>Thank you</p>      </div>

<p>Yes sure Keith, I can see how it may be more intuitive to use a simple text area in this context. I have added your request to our database.</p>      </div>
