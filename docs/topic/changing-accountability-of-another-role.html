  <dd>If I am in the garden role and i want to change the accountability of the kitchen role as I need them to put the compost in the bin in the garden so i can then work with the compost or some thing esle of their role that impacts me. Is it permitted to bring a proposal to change some role's accountability as its going to solve a tension i am experiencing in my role?</dd>

<p>I'm going to say</p><p>Yep</p><p>It's a tension and you can makes requests or you can seek a more permanent fix, like adding an accountability. It could turn into a role, though, and you might need to energize it. Lots of potential debate for who really owns the&nbsp; new accountability .&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
