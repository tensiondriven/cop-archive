      <h4>Let's learn from each other's circles</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I work for 20+ person 100% remote/work-from-home software company with 8 circles. We've been practicing Holacracy for a couple years, put all of our new hires through the Holacracy practitioner training, and just sent some to the coach training as well. We're looking to exchange Holacracy knowledge and experiences with another similarly sized (15+ person) remote work company with a solid culture around Holacracy. The idea we've discussed involves mutual observation of tactical and governance meetings followed by periodic feedback and discussions (out-of-meeting, of course). We think this will be a great way to learn from each other and further Holacracy in general. Don't worry, we expect and encourage both sides to sign NDAs before starting this experiment. Let me know if you're interested.</p>    </div>
