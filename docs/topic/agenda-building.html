      <h4>Agenda Building</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all,</p><p>I was wondering what the thought behind capturing the agenda within the meeting and "not beforehand" (3.3.4) was.</p><p>There's a consensus among members of the circle I facilitate that they don't feel comfortable making decisions affecting policy/governance despite my insistence that their roles are the most relevant to make those decisions AND that the decisions can be changed in future governance. They resolved that they would feel more prepared for meetings and ready to make decisions if tensions that were up for&nbsp;processing were made available 24 in advance.</p><p>This wouldn't exclude additional items from being added within the meeting and wouldn't dictate the order in which items were processed during the actual meeting.</p><p>*Bonus* Some circle members commented that they intended to use this to determine whether or not they would attend the meeting&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_disappointed.gif" title="disapp" /></p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
