  <dd>Lost Proposals in Glassfrog</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi: We noticed changes in Glassfrog "look and feel" in our last Governance Meeting. We also so the notice of maintenance this Sunday. Finally, we lost the information of asynchronous proposals sent to the meeting. Just wanted to know if this last point was due to the changes or we didn't press some button properly. Best regards, Allan Rhodes</dd>

<p>[@mention:450678740272473756]&nbsp;you're welcome!<br />If we know of the issue when it happens, we might not be able to&nbsp;retrieve the proposals that are lost, but we can&nbsp;probably&nbsp;prevent this issue from occurring again.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Allan and Isabelle,<br /><br />As GlassFrog Business Manager I want to reiterate how sorry we are that you ran into this issue -- we're pretty sure it was just a one-time bug as we switched from our old proposal builder code to the new code, so it shouldn't happen again. Thanks for your patience!</p>      </ul>

<p>we experienced the same issue. As we had prepared 10 proposals, it was quite frustrating !</p>      </ul>
