  <dd>Underlying hypotheses that Holacracy is based on?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello All, Maybe this question has already been answered. My question is whether there are some underlying hypotheses that Holacracy is based on? like people will perform better when they have a sense of a bigger purpose than themselves. Is there any theory behind the creation of Holacracy? Thanks! Best, Xuan</dd>

<p>I love that question and it&nbsp;remembers&nbsp;me a quote I love from Clay Shirky <strong>"When you adopt a tool you adopt the management philosophy embedded in that"</strong></p><p>For me, a core value embedded into the constitution is sovereignty. And by the way this word is mentioned at <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 1.3</a>&nbsp;- this includes NAP principles but also what we call individual Sovereignty&nbsp;(&nbsp;IGi's higher purpose is "Sovereignty powered by Holacracy"):&nbsp;<a href="https://fr.glassfrog.com/circles/101" target="_blank">https://fr.glassfrog.com/circles/101</a></p><p>Individual Sovereignty is the quality of a person or an institution to be obliged or determined only by his own will, in accordance with the purpose which it is called to express, within the limits which it can not exert control or cause a material impact within a property owned by another sovereign entity unless authorized to do so.</p><p>Another great piece (I would even say an *absolute gem*) is in <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art34" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Section 3.4</a>:</p><h3><em>3.4 Interpreting the Constitution &amp; Governance</em></h3><p><em>As a Partner of the Organization, you may use your reasonable judgment to interpret this Constitution and any Governance within the Organization, including how these apply</em> within <em>a specific situation, and then act based on your interpretation. ...</em></p><p>So the division between&nbsp;authority and obedience&nbsp;is over! and that's a full transfer&nbsp;of power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
