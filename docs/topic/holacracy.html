  <dd>I am really excited to be a part of this forum. &nbsp;Are there any members on here who are located in Chicago? &nbsp;Would love to connect with other companies or organizations that are running on Holacracy. &nbsp;</dd>

<p>Hi Sherrie and welcome! &nbsp;</p><p>Sorry you didn't get any response. I know Steve Starkey used to work with a company using Holacracy in Chicago, and last time I heard he was still in that area. You can try connecting with him <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sstarkey" target="_blank">via LinkedIn</a>. Good luck!</p><p>PS: I'm going to move your topic in the "Members Around the World" forum as it's more about connecting with others than practice questions.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
