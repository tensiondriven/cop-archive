<p>Hi Shahrooz, I'm wondering, are you asking for some kind of networking function within Glassfrog? &nbsp;Would it be a way to contact people in other organizations using Holacracy, specifically organizations with one member?<br /><br />I like the idea of practitioners being able to meet and share ideas. &nbsp;That's&nbsp;part of the purpose of this forum. &nbsp;If it were in Glassfrog, I imagine people would need to opt in to outside communication and it might attract marketing/networking spam. Maybe that would not be a totally bad thing?&nbsp;<br /><br />There are lots of publicly viewable organizations in Glassfrog, though to my knowledge there is not a directory of them so it is&nbsp;difficult to actually find them without a direct link.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Instead of having employees, I recommend others launch their own company and partner that way.&nbsp; Since Holacracy is rocking with this philosophy, as well as the Glassfrog tool, I hope to grow with y'all in interactions and more.</p><p>As of now, it seems Glassfrog is structured to enable functionality to companies of more than one employee.</p><p>What I'm asking is to reflect on how individual companies of solopreneurs may benefit from utilizing all of Glassfrog's present and future functionality...</p>      </div>

<p>Inspired by the Medicine Wheel of the Native Americans, &nbsp;in the use of which I was trained, I've been&nbsp;tracking the key&nbsp;roles of my personal lifework for 23 years.&nbsp;<br /><br />When in <a href="http://holacracy.zappos.com/public/myRoles/mlLniPtto7nv6yTLYYK-wg.zap" target="_blank">John Bunch's Hola profile</a> I discovered Zappos' Circle of Life, the purpose of which is "<span class="purpose initClosed">A place to create circles about your personal life," and its subcircle created by</span>&nbsp;John&nbsp;and aptly called The John Bunch&nbsp;Circle, I realized that I've been practicing a simplified version of 'solopreneurship' Holacracy for 20+ years before knowing about its formal discipline, tools, and methods.</p><p>Now the dots are connecting, and I will turn my Wheel of Lifework&nbsp;&nbsp;into a 1-person Circle, enhancing it with what I can borrow from Holacracy, while maintaining the&nbsp;rich&nbsp;archetypal connotations of the specific roles that I'm energizing in my lifework. Today is my birthday, a good day to do that upgrade. If anyone is interested, I will post a link to it when it will be done.</p><p>I feel that there's a great potential for solopreneurs in mapping their lifework with Holacracy. Particularly for people with a multi-dimensional lifework, it can help with weekly and moment-to-moment prioritizing, as well as discovering hidden synergies across the roles. I guess, it will also help me sustaining a greater clarity and coherence of how each role contributes to the purpose of my Circle of LifeWork. Testing those hypotheses will be one of my creative projects for 2016.</p><p>As I vaguely remember, Brian mentioned&nbsp;something about the possibility of this kind of individual use of Holacracy in his book. I don't have the book with me, so I can't look it up. Does it ring a bell to anybody?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
