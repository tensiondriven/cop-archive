  <dd>Facilitated Exercises to Demonstrate Holocracy</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Greetings from Singapore ! I've been invited to run a 90 minute "lunch n' learn" session at an organization in Singapore, and I'm running a session on Holacracy. I wanted to give folks a quick feel of how holacracy works, and was wondering if there are any exercises that one could conduct for a group of 30 or so attendees, to give them a quick "feel" of how holacracy or one of its constituent parts works. Appreciate your ideas and inputs. Cheers, Krish</dd>

<p>A governance simulation would be most effective. 4-6 people participate, the rest is fishbowling the simulation. But I find it hard to do it in 90 minutes - especially if people want to also&nbsp;hear a little more about what Holacracy is. There is a lot to be explained. Also, for a simulation you need to have access to prepared simulation materials (or invent one yourself). For this slot I would probably rather go for a straight-up presentation and leave ample space for Q&amp; A.</p>      </ul>

<p>Same here as&nbsp;[@mention:457856795977603624]&nbsp;90 min is perfect for a short overall presentation 40-45 min followed by Q&amp;A.</p><p>Simulation requires more time - 3,5 hours</p>      </ul>

<p>Hello,</p><p>nice topics. To me it depends on time and public. You can try to animate a meeting to manage tension and show how roles can quickly resolve issues?</p>      </ul>
