      <h4>Request for information about members excluded from meetings</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all,</p><p>We have one multi role in our Holacracy structure that where all the role-fillers have been excluded from meetings. One of the members wants to make some governance changes but cannot do this as all members are excluded from meetings.</p><p>I at first thought that the role-filler could pitch the lead link of the circle on the desired change so that if the lead link thought this was a good tension to process he could take it to the meeting. The lead link responds to this (thinking about it this seem logical) that it is not one of the accountabilities.</p><p>Being dead in the water I could not see an immediate way forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Anybody have some insights on this?</p>    </div>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Let's have a look on Holacracy Constitution 2.3.2 and 2.3.3...</p><p>2.3.2 EXCLUSION FOR MULTI-FILLED ROLES<br />If multiple Partners are assigned to the same Defined Role in a Circle,<br />the Circle may enact a Policy that limits how many of them are Core<br />Circle Members as a result of that Role assignment. However, the Policy<br />must allow at least one of the Partners filling the Role to repr esent it as<br />a Core Circle Member, and must specify how that representative will be<br />determined.<br />In addition, any Partners representing the Role have the duty to consider<br />and process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partners, exactly as a<br />Rep Link would were the Role a Sub-Circle, unless the Policy de fines an<br />alternate pathway for the excluded Partners to process Tensions related to<br />that Role.<br />2.3.3 EXCLUSION FOR MINOR ALLOCATIONS<br />Sometimes, a Partner allocates only a very minor, nearly insign ificant<br />amount of attention to a Defined Role in a Circle. If the Circle ’s Lead<br />Link reasonably believes this is the case, the Lead Link may exclude that<br />Partner from serving as a Core Circle Member as a result of that Role<br />assignment.<br />If a Partner is so excluded, the Lead Link has a duty to consider and<br />process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partner, exactly as a Rep Link<br />would were the Role a Sub-Circle, unless an alternate pathway i s defined<br />for the excluded Partner to process Tensions related to that Role.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p>      </div>
