  <dd>Request for information about members excluded from meetings</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi all, We have one multi role in our Holacracy structure that where all the role-fillers have been excluded from meetings. One of the members wants to make some governance changes but cannot do this as all members are excluded from meetings. I at first thought that the role-filler could pitch the lead link of the circle on the desired change so that if the lead link thought this was a good tension to process he could take it to the meeting. The lead link responds to this (thinking about it...</dd>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Let's have a look on Holacracy Constitution 2.3.2 and 2.3.3...</p><p>2.3.2 EXCLUSION FOR MULTI-FILLED ROLES<br />If multiple Partners are assigned to the same Defined Role in a Circle,<br />the Circle may enact a Policy that limits how many of them are Core<br />Circle Members as a result of that Role assignment. However, the Policy<br />must allow at least one of the Partners filling the Role to repr esent it as<br />a Core Circle Member, and must specify how that representative will be<br />determined.<br />In addition, any Partners representing the Role have the duty to consider<br />and process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partners, exactly as a<br />Rep Link would were the Role a Sub-Circle, unless the Policy de fines an<br />alternate pathway for the excluded Partners to process Tensions related to<br />that Role.<br />2.3.3 EXCLUSION FOR MINOR ALLOCATIONS<br />Sometimes, a Partner allocates only a very minor, nearly insign ificant<br />amount of attention to a Defined Role in a Circle. If the Circle â€™s Lead<br />Link reasonably believes this is the case, the Lead Link may exclude that<br />Partner from serving as a Core Circle Member as a result of that Role<br />assignment.<br />If a Partner is so excluded, the Lead Link has a duty to consider and<br />process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partner, exactly as a Rep Link<br />would were the Role a Sub-Circle, unless an alternate pathway i s defined<br />for the excluded Partner to process Tensions related to that Role.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p>      </ul>
