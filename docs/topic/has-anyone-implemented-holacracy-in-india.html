  <dd>Has anyone implemented holacracy in India?</dd>

  <dd>Hello, everyone. I'm very new to the subject - I’m specifically interested in knowing how restructuring an organization can help overcome cultural obstacles that are often experienced by multi-national companies. For example, there’s an assumption that holacracy can empower employees to improve self-management skills but to what degree can this impact a culture that is very hierarchically organized and very accustomed to following instructions?</dd>
