  <dd>Hi All, Does anyone have experience with this subject? How to give transparency in how the lead link selects a partner for a role? I have some ideas myself, but perhaps it is already invented somewhere else and can I learn from your experiences. Thx, Christel</dd>

<p>Hi Christel,</p><p>My immediate answer is "GlassFrog" - Lead Link would capture the name of the person he has assigned to such role.</p><p>Secondly, there is nothing in the constitution re the fact that the Lead Link should make explicit how he selects partners to fill roles. This role has got the authority by an accountability (see appendix A of constitution) to do so.</p><p>In case, tension surface re the way a specific Lead Link assigns partners to roles, then process it. There are so many different ways to "solve" any tension.</p><p>For instance, within iGi Partners, the company I work with and using Holacracy since 2010, there is nothing explicit per governance re the "How" should Lead Links of our 5 circles assign roles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Christel,</p><p>To add on my previous answer, with some of our clients we implement Holacracy in, we've developed some Apps like a market place in which, as one of the many functions it offers, &nbsp;partners make explicit the roles they would love to fill and makes mandatory for Lead Links per Policy to look at the market place before any new assignments for deciding being informed of all desires coming from partners...&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p><strong>What info do you put in the market place? Is it only the role, or the role with competences like minimum scrum master degree, or ... years experience in...?</strong></p><p>The answer may vary from one client to another - minimum would be the role and the level of interest, then you could add some kinda competencies (some of our clients use Badges for competences needed by the Organization). So the explicit heuristic used by a LL for assigning would be something like - assigning the partners having the greatest desire to fill the role and having the appropriate competences. You may also define priorities within the different criteria...</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Bernard Marie,</p><p>Thank you for your answer. I know it is the LL doesn't need to make the selection explicit . But in my circle the LL whishes to do so. He 's also thinking about giving transparency in the competences he sees for the roles he wants to assign. He likes to this in the spirit of Holacracy. What info do you put in the market place? Is it only the role, or the role with competences like minimum scrum master degree, or ... years experience in...?</p>      </ul>
