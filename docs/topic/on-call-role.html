  <dd>On Call Role</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>On our proposal on call engineer role has accountability of being available 24/7. This has raised objection from several partner, saying that this would be breach of employment contract with regards to working hour. But is this a valid objection, as the one raising the objection didn't know which role has the objection, he objects as a partner. What should we do in such situation?</dd>
