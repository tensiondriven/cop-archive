      <h4>On Call Role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>On our proposal on call engineer role has accountability of being available 24/7. This has raised objection from several partner, saying that this would be breach of employment contract with regards to working hour.&nbsp;</p><p>But is this a valid objection, as the one raising the objection didn't know which role has the objection, he objects as a partner.&nbsp;</p><p>What should we do in such situation?</p>    </div>

<p>Does it mean that we cannot use "standing by 24/7 to response client's question" as accountability? Because this sentence address the tension of the needs to do so by engineer (proposer)</p>      </div>

<p>I am not saying that a person should be available 24/7. By this policy, I am constraining the Lead Link who should assign enough person to make sure this role is filled 24/7. Does it make sense?</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Fajar,<br />A short contribution from my perspective.</p><p>"Responding to the client" is an constitutional accountability.</p><p>"Responding to the client by 24/7 " sounds unconstitutional, as it defines the way the accountability has to be enacted. =&gt; NVGO</p><p>I join Margaux comment. A way to precise the 24/7 availibility needed is to adopt a policy.</p><p>Impacts on the employement law contracts are not due to Holacracy, just to the real life and the 24/7 availability demand. Holacracy space is just about organizing the work. Law contract topics are part of the "association" space :&nbsp; the relationship beetwen the company and the employees. It's a kind of "ressource individual agreement"</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>      </div>

<p>Governance doesn't commit resources. This ROLE may have an expectation on it to be available 24/7 - but it could be filled by multiple people, who between them provide continuous coverage in a legally compliant way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>It would work for me to have this accountability as you original stated it&nbsp;because it's making something important clear: that in your organisation on-call support needs to be available&nbsp;24/7. Governance for me is all about setting clear expectations. Now - how you go about making this happen? That's a tactical issue. And maybe part of that tactical work includes looking at employment law, contacts etc.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hey,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many thoughts on that:</p><p>1/ “Being available” is not an on going activity, therefor not a valid accountability - you could object NVGO</p><p>2/ A role is always available - the person filling the role may not</p><p>In your specific case, I guess the tension is to make sure that&nbsp;there is always someone filling the Engineer role. In this case, if you are the Lead Link, you can assign this role to multiple persons with different focus - you are still constrained by the work agreement because it is a legal document. If as a role filler you need it, then I would suggest creating a policy like “There must always be someone filling the engineer role so the service doesn't stop” (not proper I am sure but you can get the sense).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a Facilitator though, you can't judge objections. So I would go to integration and try to explain that to the objectors to see if given that, the objection is still relevant.</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you Margaux, especially point 1.</p><p>However for the policy, could you please enlighten me how to apply this? knowing that in employment contract, employee has a fixed office hours but this always available policy doesn't comply to it. Or should the proposer ask legal role to change employment contract as a project first ? And only after that we can proceed with the "on call role"?</p>      </div>
