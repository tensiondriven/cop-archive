      <h4>Domain Policies, Legacy Policies, Hybrid</h4>

<p>Howdy Folks -</p><p>Okay, so - let me divide and conquer a bit into 1) Domain Policies and 2) Legacy Policies.</p><p>Context for those who don't know us, we're a hybrid still - with our Board of Directors still operating as-was, and nearly all of our local and topic-oriented volunteer groups operating as-was. &nbsp;A year ago the Board signed over operational control to our primary circle called Lead Operating Circle. &nbsp;I hesitate to call it 'Anchor' because our hybrid structure makes me think our Board is 'Anchor' and in fact that's how we have it recorded in GlassFrog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) re: Domain Policies - in Philadelphia I heard from Brian and others, that once a Role has been granted a Domain, that the Role itself can create a Policy about its use or access by others. &nbsp;That makes sense to me - say the domain is an office printer and I want to grant access to all team members to use it but I dunno, want to limit the size of print jobs or require team members to leave it in good condition when done using it., However, I do not see how to do this based on Constitution or in GlassFrog.</p><p>QUESTION: &nbsp;How does a Domain 'owner' create or institute a policy granting or limiting access?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) re: Legacy Policies / Hybrid Organization - we've been rubbing up against this one for a while now and as holder of our policy and procedure directories and content I'm really beginning to feel tension (aka, a panic tornado in my thoracic vertebrae) and am undertaking a project to create some guidelines for clarity re: operational v institutional policies, and how/when to trump legacy policies as our structure and methods evolve from tension processing.</p><p>QUESTION: &nbsp;Help? &nbsp;As I have reviewed Constitution re: Legacy in 5.4 I believe that all the previous content remains and is only replaced as new Governance overrides. &nbsp;So... are there clean lines to what is operational and what is institutional? &nbsp;I'm thinking our adoption/cede authority process may have set us up for ongoing confusion. &nbsp;Help?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2a) re: all the above - um, should our "Lead Operating Circle" be the anchor? &nbsp;Maybe with the Board of Directors as a separate entity that we cross-link with? &nbsp;Right now the Board is the anchor and we have a Rep Link.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, I am not even remotely embarrassed that I don't / we don't yet know all the answers to the above or that I/we are exposing our ignorance or naivete. &nbsp;Nope, not at all!</p>    </div>

<p>Thank you Mary for your reply - I always wondered what that + was doing there and now that makes great sense. &nbsp;I'll be exploring that with domains in my own Roles then inform others on my team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Re: the legacy stuff, that also helps - the idea that we could put a 'good until X date' on older material to give us time to reproduce that which still makes sense in the new structure.</p><p><br />Lastly, on the Board, I dug up our 'cede authority' proposals and it appears to me that the Board is in fact <em>not</em> our anchor circle but that our "Lead Operating Circle" is. &nbsp;I'm not sure how this changes things and am continuing to research.</p>      </div>
