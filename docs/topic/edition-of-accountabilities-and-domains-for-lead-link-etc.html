  <dd>Edition of accountabilities and domains for Lead Link etc.</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi. We have just started our trip in Holacracy. We are located in Poland and we use Polish language. Not all our people read and write fluent English. It would be perfect to have Polish version of Glass Frog, but we are ok with the existing one, we just fill it with the content in Polish. Tension: The only thing we are not able to edit are the accountabilities, etc. that are taken from Constitution. (Lead Link and the others) How about opening this for edition? Regards</dd>
