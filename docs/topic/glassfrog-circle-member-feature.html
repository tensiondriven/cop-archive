  <dd>GlassFrog Circle member feature</dd>

  <dd>Hi, One of our clients asked for this specific feature and I was wondering if anyone here would find it useful too: on the circle interface, you have a tab named “Circle Members” and they are all mixed. Our client would like this list to be sorted by alphabetical order so that it is easier for them to find if the person they are looking for is a core circle member of that circle or not. Note: I've told that client that they can always check on the person's profil but it is less convenient.</dd>
