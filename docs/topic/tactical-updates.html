  <dd>Hi Alexia, is it possible to get updates on tactical progress out of meetings? I now get updates on&nbsp;the outcomes of the tactical meeting. Additionally it would be great to get for example an end of week email with all the project status changes/completions. Especially in virtual/mobile teams this would be a great feature. Koen</dd>

<p>Hi Koen!</p><p>That sounds like an interesting idea. Brian was just pitching for something related, so I'll add a note and integrate something into a feature request. Thank you!</p><p>Do you think that having an email is important, or would it serve if you could see these metrics in GlassFrog somewhere?</p>      </ul>

<p>I think my answer would be "it depends". And I don't think I hold a universal truth here. Both can definitely work. I am primarily email focused (like I read the community update on mail). But something like "your updates" in Glassfrog with all updates of circles I follow could work equally well I guess</p>      </ul>
