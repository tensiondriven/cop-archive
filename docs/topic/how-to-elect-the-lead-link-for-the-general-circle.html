Could you (or any other wonderful member of this community <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> !) tell me the "why" of this limit about domains for Anchor circles without LL ? Was there a tension who brought to this ? Another aspect of my interrogation is : in an Anchor circle with LL, why don't we have the same limitation, what doesn't make it necessary too (some part of LL authorities ?) ?</p><p>I'm aware that the LL has an accountability about resources allocation : "Allocating the Circle’s resources across its various Projects and/or Roles" ; but that's an accountability, not a domain so that there is no exclusive control granted to the LL about resources.</p><p>And by the way, a connected questions I have : if in holacracy what's not explicitly forbidden is allowed, what does prevent any member in any role to spend money and make investments ? If there is no policy about it ? I feel sometimes inconfortable about that question when people ask me, knowing that the LL has no domain about it (and I can imagine why it has not). I wonder how you deal with it, guys.</p><p>Thanks a lot !</p>      </ul>

<p>Great questions! I don't have all the answers, but I can point you to another thread which covers some of it:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/issues/75" target="_blank">https://github.com/holacracyon...nstitution/issues/75</a></p><p>I hope that helps!&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>So that is for the Anchor Circle. For the GCC the Lead Link is appointed by the Ratifiers.</p>      </ul>

<p>Shammi,&nbsp;</p><p>The largest circle of the organization may or may not have a Lead Link.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art521" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article 5 (5.2.1)</a> of the Constitution says, "The Ratifiers may appoint an initial Lead Link of the Anchor Circle. Alternatively, the Ratifiers may leave the Anchor Circle without a Lead Link, and create one or more initial Cross Links to the Anchor Circle in lieu of a Lead Link."&nbsp;</p><p>And if there is no Lead Link? Well, <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art522" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.2</a> says...&nbsp;</p><p>If the Anchor Circle has no Lead Link, all decisions that normally require Lead Link authority become valid outputs of the Circle’s Governance Process. Any Role within the Circle may thus exercise Lead Link authority by proposing a decision as a Governance change for the Circle, using the process and rules in Article III.</p><p>Further, in an Anchor Circle with no Lead Link, the normal authority of Roles to autocratically impact Circle Domains (per&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art212">Section 2.1.2</a>) is revoked. Instead, the Circle’s Roles may only impact its Domains if a Policy explicitly allows the impact, or, alternatively, by proposing the action using the Circle’s Governance Process, exactly as described above for exercising Lead Link authority."</p><p>Hope that helps!&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
