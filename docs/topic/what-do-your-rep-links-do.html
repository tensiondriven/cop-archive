<p>Interesting question. In our company they do&nbsp;things out of their actual&nbsp;accountabilities and what the role was intended (but still generate value)...</p><p>They regularly meet together discussing if they see similar&nbsp;issues distributed among the circles or things their circle-members have in common. E.g. together they found out people are not happy with the way general communication works in our company and employees lack feedback as they were used to get from their line manager before Holacracy.</p><p>Those are "tensions" people don't mention in their circles because a)&nbsp;it has nothing to do with the roles, purpose and accountabilities they have or&nbsp;b) they don't "sense" it (they don't realize they have a tension until they hear someone has a problem they share too, but were not aware of it).</p><p>So our Rep Links became like "sensors", discussing things they see inside their circles and could be improved. They act&nbsp;like a single point of contact for outsiders - but not only for the supercircle, but for everybody.</p>      </div>

<p>I can share what I do as the Rep Link of Ecosystem Circle within H1: people comes to me and expose their tensions (tensions they can't process within the circle itself because it is broader than that). I try to understand it and have a skype to dive in further and then I make a proposal out of governance. If it is escalated, I'll come to the next governance meeting.</p><p>Though I think I could have some value attending tactical meetings but I don't have the time because of client engagements. It might be a good opportunity to represent the Ecosytem and have a voice at the GCC directly.</p><p>If your tension is that Rep Links don't quite know how to manage their role, you could organize sessions between Rep Links where they can share their best practices. A good sign, in a early Holacracy practice, is when Rep Links attend meetings of the Super Circle even if they don't bring any tension.</p>      </div>
