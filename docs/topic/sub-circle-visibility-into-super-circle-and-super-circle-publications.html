      <h4>sub-circle visibility into super-circle and super-circle publications</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>A couple related questions here. But let's consider the following:</p><ol><li>Structure: GCC -&gt; Sub-Circle</li><li>A role in Sub-Circle requests an accountability (through Sub-Circle RepLink) on a specific role in GCC. This accountability involves creation and maintenance of a document. Let's call it a "best practices" document.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And now for my questions:</p><ol><li>While I understand that the GCC can see Sub-Circle though&nbsp;visibility into Sub-Circle is "discouraged" as Sub-Circle should be seen as a black box or simply a role, visibility of GCC from the&nbsp;perspective of Sub-Circle is less clear to me. I don't see how Sub-Circle roles are even aware of GCC or GCC roles, other than LeadLink and RepLink (of Sub-Circle).&nbsp;</li><li>Regarding the accountability outlined above: how are roles in Sub-Circle to be made aware of the document created/maintained by the role in GCC? Or is this not really a Holacracy issue at all? Perhaps there is a more Holacratic proposal here that I'm not seeing...</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hey Ray,</p><p>My quick answers...</p><p>1. Think of it like a neighborhood with several houses. If you are walking down the street (GCC), you can't really see inside the individual houses (subcircle). But, if you are <em>inside</em> the house (subcircle), you can easily look outside and see the street and the rest of the neighborhood (GCC).&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp; If the subcircle wants to see the document, as it's created or updated, then include that in the accountability. So, something like, "Notifying @Subcircle when changes are made to document" would work (not the most elegant, but you get the idea).&nbsp;</p>      </div>
