  <dd>Domains &amp; Policies - when is a governance meeting required?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, Can someone help clarify this potentially major point of confusion. If a roll filler sets a policy on a domain of their role (having suitably communicated and published this policy) and another role raises a tension caused by this policy, do they need to propose changes formally via a governance meeting? Or is formal governance discussion / change to policy only for domains and policies owned by the circle? or does the LL have authority to set these outside of Governance?</dd>
