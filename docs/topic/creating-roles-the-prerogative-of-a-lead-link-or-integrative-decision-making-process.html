  <dd>Creating roles: the prerogative of a lead-link or integrative decision-making process</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>A member of the circle put forward a proposal to remove one of the accountabilities of his role and transfer another role in this circle. There was a misunderstanding, this decision should be made through an integrative decision-making process or is this matter under the lead-link? Can the lead-link veto a decision made through an integrative decision-making process? Can a lead link take such a decision on its own? Thank you!</dd>

<p>You are correct. &nbsp;The lead link has the explicit accountability of defining metrics for the circle.</p><p>So, the steps are as follows:</p><p>1. &nbsp;Role created using IDM process in Governance, or asynchronous Governance process&nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;Lead Link &nbsp;assigns a role-filler to the role</p><p>3. &nbsp;Lead Link defines metrics for the circle and specifies which role is responsible for reporting the metric.</p><p>(Const. 4.1.1 - Duty of Transparency) Role-fillers must also track and report on any metrics assigned to your Roles by the Circle’s Lead Link, or by any other Role or process granted the authority to define the Circle’s metrics.</p>      </ul>

<p>Danila, thank you for the answer! But I don't quite understand what "Anchor Circle's Accountabilities" is. In my understanding, accountabilities must relate to some role. Does this mean that the anchor circle lead link can create new roles without an IDM process?</p>      </ul>

<p>A proposal to remove an accountability can only be made through the governance process (Const. 3.1).&nbsp; Any core circle member can make such a proposal, including but not limited to the lead link (Const. 3.2).&nbsp; Any core circle member can raise an objection to the proposal during the objection step of IDM, including but not limited to the lead link (Const. 3.2).&nbsp; The lead link does not carry special authority, on his or her own, to veto such a proposal or make such a change.</p><p>As for "transfer another role in the circle," I don't know if you mean that the proposal was to transfer the removed accountability mentioned above or to make some other kind of transfer (such as transferring that role from one role-filler to another).&nbsp; This meaning would impact whether it's an IDM decision or a lead link decision, but changing the role's accountabilities is always a governance issue.</p>      </ul>

<p>Thank you for reply! &nbsp;I meant the proposal to edit the role, not transferring the role to another person.<br />Another question. According to the Constitution, Lid-link assigns metrics to the circle. The role is created via IDM. And then Lid-link assigns her metrics. Do I understand correctly?</p>      </ul>

<p>It doesn't. LL can modify Anchor Circle's Accountabilities, not Roles' or Sub-Circles'.</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;Now the Lid link of the Anchor Circle should withdraw the proposal?<br /><br />No. LL of "IT Development" and Anchor Circle LL should search for a proposal, that would address initial tension and the objection raised. That's what IDM is about.</p>      </ul>

<p>I had another question.<br />But how about the Anchor Circle?</p><p>Our Anchor Circle's Lid-link is at the same time the owner of the business. For example, he considers that it is necessary to expand the responsibilities of the "IT development" circle. Suppose that he offered this proposal for processing via IDM process and the lid-link of the "IT development" circle expressed valid objections to this proposal.&nbsp;Now the Lid link of the Anchor Circle should withdraw the proposal?</p><p>The constitution says:<br />5.2.4 Updating the Anchor Circle<br />The Lead Link of the Anchor Circle has the<br />Authority to name the Circle, clarify its<br />Domains, and add or modify its<br />Accountabilities.</p><p>Does this mean that the Lid link of the Anchor Circle can edit the role of the Anchor Circle on its own without IDM process?</p>      </ul>

<p>No.</p><p>Anchor Circle can have Accountabilities as well as any other Role/Circle — that would be Organization's Accountabilities. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

        <br/>
<p>But how can Accountabilities exist on their own? There must be someone who performs them. Is the Lid-link itself to perform them, until these Accountabilities are transferred to the other role via the IDM process? Sorry if I'm asking trivial questions, I just want to figure this out)</p>      </ul>

<p>Nadir, accountability is not a 'job to be done', this is an ongoing expectation of some outcome recorded in an org structure.&nbsp;Which role &nbsp;performs it&nbsp;within the Circle is not visible from the outside.&nbsp;</p><p>When some accountability is assigned to the circle by super-circle, Lead Link gets it by default untill it is assigned to some other role on the circle's governance meeting.</p><p>For instance, I as an Accountan want IT Development to move our IT systems into the cloud and maintain them there. Then on the super-circle governance I propose adding "Moving IT systems into the cloud" to the IT Dev circle accountabilities.</p><p>Then on Governance IT Dev circle creates new role called "Cloud master" with purpose "Move all our IT systems into the cloud and make them work flawlessly", but from the outside I don't see it and don't actually care.</p><p>Article 5.2.4 and Anchor circle are sort of exceptions, and I personally would not follow that process because it's a sort of CEO-like governance.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
