  <dd>Hi, I have a question regarding the Reaction Round as a Facilitator. I can give pathways not only to the Proposer but also to the other participants? It is a good practice or is it considered as a reaction to reaction and the coaching for the other participants should be done in a time-out? Thanks</dd>
