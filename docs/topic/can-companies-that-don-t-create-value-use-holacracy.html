      <h4>Can companies that don't create value use Holacracy?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi!</p><p>I may be wrong, but in my opinion Forex brokers don't create&nbsp;value, but rather they exploit people instincts to make money. And some of these companies might&nbsp;think they could use Holacracy to better operate.&nbsp;Taking into account that Holacracy is meant to be used&nbsp;by&nbsp;the purpose driven organisations, do you think companies that just make money can succeed in Holacracy adoption?</p>    </div>

<p>Bernard,</p><p>let me explain why I think these questions are connected. According to Spiral Dynamics theory, a company cannot skip the level of development. I don't know for sure, but I see similarities between spiral dynamics and integral model, on which Frederic Laloux book is based. So I think that probably this is also true for the stages of development of integral theory. And if so, you cannot adopt Holacracy at the rational level, because it is based on evolutionary/integral values. There's one more level to experience.</p><p>And it seems like none of the Forex companies have the mission, they just have the goal to make money.&nbsp;And it&nbsp;probably means they should operate at the rational level.</p><p>I personally worked for a Forex company a while ago. And I felt very bad about what the company does. I wonder if there are people who believe that Forex brokers&nbsp;create value.</p><p>P.S. While I was writing this reply, I thought that value is something subjective, and hence if there are people who think there is actually value in that, then there is, probably...</p>      </div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>could it be that the only purpose of some organisation is to not exist?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">My answer is no - and may be I'm wrong - For me the Purpose of an Org. is the deep reason why it exists from an evolutionary perspective. So, as one Org. exists, it has a "Raison d'être".</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>P.S. Or, perhaps, a company culturally isn't ready for Holacracy adoption, and if you never stop it will eventually go bankrupt?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Different subjects for me behind your question. As I like to say Holacracy is not for everyone, every Org. , every culture.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">And re going bankrupt, we've a case of a company we've helped implemented Holacracy some years ago that went bankrupt. &nbsp;They would say and I agree, that this was not due to Holacracy adoption.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>      </div>
