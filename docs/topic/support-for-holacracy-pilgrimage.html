  <dd>Support for Holacracy Pilgrimage</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I am on a Holacracy Pilgrimage in US visiting different organisations practicing Holacracy till 12 june. I need support in the following. 1. Any one open to have me visit their organisation which is working on Holacracy. I am already hooked up with some and grateful to them. 2. Financial support is welcome to support my travel and stay. Please see the note and you can make personal or organisational contributions. See more at https://goo.gl/1P1Moy 3. Need some one who can host me in Kansas...</dd>
