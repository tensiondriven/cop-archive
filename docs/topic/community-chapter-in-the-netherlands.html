<p>Hello everyone!<br /><br />I came back from a Holiday and found myself swamped in the things that accumulated over that period.</p><p>If anyone would like to take over and organize our first meeting, that would be awesome.<br />Otherwise, we will have to postpone it by a few weeks.</p><p>I received a lot of emails, so I am sorry that I did not reply to all of them yet.<br />This group did not even really start&nbsp;and it is a success already!<br />So thank you all that joined our Slack, sent emails and participated in the Brainstorm meeting!! :-)</p>      </div>
