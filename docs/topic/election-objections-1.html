  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I'm looking for clarity on 3.3.6(f) (Integrative Election Process). The pertinent line is, "If any Objections are raised, the Facilitator may choose to process them normally, or to discard the Proposal either immediately after the Objection round or at any point during the integration step." Does this mean that the facilitator can choose to discard the proposal even if a raised objection is not valid? What if someone asks the facilitator to test the objection, and it does turn out to be...</dd>

<p>Hi Geoff,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My interpretation is that the Facilitator can indeed choose to propose someone else if an objection is raised, even if not valid (we assume that the Facilitator, in this case, didn't see it). Anyone can ask to test the objection but only in the Integration Step, which means that if the Facilitator choose not the integrate the objection and to propose someone else, nobody can ask to test the objection.</p><p>If you think the person is not a good Facilitator, you may.. well.. ask for an election <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>
