  <dd>Model or Theory to process tension</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Dear community, I am studying business psychology in Stuttgart, Germany and I am currently writing my thesis on Holacracy. In an interview study, I aim to deal more in-depth with the question on how holacratic organizations process tension into change. Therefore, I have two questions from a rather academic perspective: 1. Do you know of a model (or any sort of classification/ cluster) that categorizes tension within 'conventional' organizations? 2. Do you know of a theory that might be...</dd>

<p>Hi Selen,&nbsp;</p><p>Here are two&nbsp;pointers, some of which I also mentioned in our conversation:<br /><br />The Concept of Creative Tension, as described in Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline". <a href="http://www.productiveflourishing.com/a-users-guide-to-creative-tension/" target="_blank">This article</a> provides a nice intro and some pointers to further reading materials.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">Cognitive dissonance</a>, a&nbsp;concept from psychology, could provide some good starting points. The wikipedia article also refers to some alternative theories.</p><p>This is very interesting topic and I'm curious to learn more about what you discover in your research.</p><p>Best, Patrick</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Selen, ,</p><p>About explaining tension in the context of holacratic organizations, just have a look on the Holacracy Constitution, 1.2.1:</p><p><em>1.2.1 PROCESSING TENSIONS</em><br /><em>You are responsible for monitoring how your Role’s Purpose and</em><br /><em>Accountabilities are expressed, and comparing that to your vision of their</em><br /><em>ideal potential expression, to identify <strong>gaps between the current reality and</strong></em><br /><em><strong>a potential you sense</strong> (each gap is a “Tension”). You are also responsible</em><br /><em>for trying to resolve those Tensions by using the authorities and other</em><br /><em>mechanisms available to you under this Constitution.</em></p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
