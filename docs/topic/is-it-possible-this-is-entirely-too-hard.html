  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>So I'm fairly new into exploring holacracy, the owner of a small preschool program. We are innovative in the work we do with children and looking for a better structure but I'm concerned this is possibly just entirely too difficult or too much to ask of all the teachers who have already very busy schedules. How do organizations balance that? I am most concerned about in the beginning because I know it will become more simple over time. Thanks!</dd>
