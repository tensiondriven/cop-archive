      <h4>French speaker needed for co-delivering Facilitation Assessments</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>&lt;<a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/ALWEEBLxridJD7imC_zubeuUsY9BSWPh5iI" target="_blank">French translation of this post available here</a>&gt;</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As some of you know, HolacracyOne offers "Facilitation Assessments" that people can take to get experience facilitating governance meetings and potentially earn the Certified Facilitator or Coach credentials (more <a href="http://holacracy.org/licensing#certification" target="_blank" title="Holacracy Certification &amp; Assessments">here</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Lead Link of our <a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/circles/1506" target="_blank">Ecosystem circle</a>, I'd like to expand this offering to French speakers, however for that we need 1 French speaker to co-deliver the assessment with me. The issue is that there is no available French speaker with a Coach credential at the moment, and without assessment for French speakers to get this credential... we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I'm wondering if there is a French speaker out there, with at least a <strong>Practitioner</strong> credential, who would be interested in delivering this assessment with me to allow the French Holacracy community to grow. This work will be compensated, you would not have to assess &amp; score candidates, but you'll need to participate in a governance meeting simulation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you are delivering the assessment, <em>you won't qualify for taking the assessment as candidate</em>, because you will obviously be&nbsp;privy&nbsp;to the details of its design...&nbsp;<strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">In other words, I'm looking for a French-speaking certified Practitioner who's not intending to get the Facilitator or Coach credential any time soon.</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Let me know if you are interested!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="smaller"><em>Apologies if this post isn't quite about "Holacracy practice", I didn't find a better forum to post into (admins feel free to move it).</em></span></p>    </div>
