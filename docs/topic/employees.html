<p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />I&nbsp;read a lot about Holacracy the last time - and there is one question I have; my experiences as a leader is that there are always people who need more instructions than others; how does Holacracy deal with those employees?<br />for me, personally, it is a perfect management-system, but I know that there are other characters who are not able to work in this way; and for me this not only a disadvantage, although sometimes for me it was very exhausting to handle the team and different characters;</p><p>Maybe you have similar experiences...</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Elena, one way to bridge this gap (tension) is to make the role-ationship explicit. For example the social media role is responsible for "sending new customer feedback to the website developer". And the copywriter for "giving feedback to the Blogger on new articles written".&nbsp;</p><p>In that way you make explicit that roles depend on each other. For expertise, capacity or experience. In quite a more natural way than employees used to depend on managers.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>If I understand you correctly, the tension is that some participants in the organization still act/think like employees who require management. Like&nbsp;[@mention:508806870940037068]&nbsp;points out, Holacracy gives possibility through empowerment (i.e., imposing self-responsibility).&nbsp;<em>This is not for everyone</em> and some will need to opt out in order to make way for incoming participants that can better align with the self-governance culture from their start. In time, I think the claim that practicing Holacracy helps transform those who are willing to submit to the call for self-leadership proves true. Still, for many humans, there is a huge gap between being led and having a self-leadership mentality.</p><p>One way we with Likewise address developing self-leaders is through guided reading and discussion group interactions. Some people (I'd say&nbsp;<em>most</em>) simply have no concept of self-leadership and need exposure to the rich history of literature that supports this contemporary self-governance movement. From our work with prison inmates and exposing them to the possibilities/blessings of self-governance/leadership, I'd say that your regular run-of-the-mill "employee" could stand to benefit from a similar community learning experience.</p>      </div>

<p>People are different and their abilities and learning speed as well. It creates a lot of tension in you as Manager, if you have to compensate the difference, because you feel responsible for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Holacracy gives everyone the possibility to regulate the learning speed by them-self(-&gt; being self-responsible). If there is frequent need (=tension) for support, the organisation will&nbsp;create solutions. Like the good examples Julia mentioned.</p><p>And the best - no one has to be exhausted anymore :-)</p>      </div>
