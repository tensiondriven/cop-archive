      <h4>Rep Link vs Lead Link Objections in the Super-Circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello Holacracy Community Members,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I always thought that the Rep Link of a Sub-Circle was doing the exact same job as the Lead Link of that Sub-Circle when they were in the Super-Circle: both embodying the role.</p><p>In fact, my interpretation of the constitution is that it is more subtle:</p><p>Rep Link:&nbsp;</p><p>- Purpose: Within the Super-Circle, the Rep Link holds the Purpose of the SubCircle;</p><p>- Accountability: Providing visibility to the Super-Circle into the health of the Sub-Circle, including reporting on any metrics or checklist items assigned to the whole Sub-Circle</p><p>So the Rep Link only holds the PURPOSE of the Sub-Circle&nbsp;and provides visibility on metrics or checklist items during tactical meetings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lead Link: from the Super-Circle perspective, he IS the entire role,&nbsp;as if there were no Circle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, my question/reflection is: in a governance meeting of the Super-Circle, if someone&nbsp;propose to add a domain on the Sub-Circle (let's imagine it is a valide proposal), I would say that only the Lead Link of that Sub-Circle could object unless this proposal hurts the purpose of the Sub-Circle but I wouldn't imagine a domain hurting the purpose of a circle... What do you think?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any thought, insight, etc. is more than welcome <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p>    </div>
