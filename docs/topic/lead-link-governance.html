      <h4>Lead Link Governance</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>The Lead Link has this accountability:&nbsp; "Structuring the Governance of the Circle to enact its Purpose and Accountabilities".&nbsp; Does that give the Lead Link a blank check on Proposal validity, or is it still appropriate for the Facilitator to validate that the Lead Link has a legitimate Tension per 3.2.3?</p>    </div>

<p>Thanks for the quick replies.&nbsp; Our habit had been that Lead Link proposals were tested like any others.</p><p>The question had really stemmed from the idea that as a LL, I am able to "...better express ... an Accountability..." (i.e., the accountability to structure governance of the Circle) by making a proposal, therefore all of my proposals are valid by default.&nbsp; However, it is the act of proposing--not the governance itself--that helps the LL better express that accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;[@mention:544274267239861666], your reminder helped me make that connection.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Geoff</p><p>Which do you think it is? <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>A&nbsp;reminder about accountabilities may help -&nbsp;with an accountability we are saying "<em>anybody CAN do this, but we an EXEPCT that this role will on an on-going basis give conscious consideration to whether any action is needed on this".&nbsp;</em>So this LL accountability is saying "anybody CAN structure the circle using Governance, but we expect the LL to think about whether it needs doing and to take action accordingly".</p><p>There are some good previous posts on this general topic (Lead Links and Governance) in the forum which are worth checking out.&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes, Andrew&nbsp;</p>      </div>
