      <h4>Project Updates</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>If a Project is accepted by the Lead Link of a Sub-Circle, the work is likely not getting done by that Lead Link.&nbsp; Likely it is being done by a Role in the Sub-Circle (which may itself be a Circle... so it trickles down).&nbsp; When the time comes to give an update at the top most Circle, the Lead Link of the Sub-Circle has basically become a go-between.&nbsp; That means he/she has to go to the person doing the actual work before the tactical meeting to see if there is an update.</p><p>It somehow feels a little off to me that the LL has this administrative duty of tracking down project statuses for upward reporting purposes (and also reminds me of terrible, old hierarchy situations in which I used to work).&nbsp; Does anybody else have any thoughts on this or tricks they use to get this information to percolate up automatically?</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Geoff,</p><p>As a LL of the sub-circle I would ask the role to create a project within that sub-circle and give updates in Tactical meetings. That way I would know the progress and do not need to specifically track down the progress of that project.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not know if that's the way to do it, but it works for us.</p>      </div>

<p>Both the Lead Link and Rep Link can do the updates - no need to check with the role before. If none of them have informations, they can say “no update” and they'll come with updates once they have them (during a tactical meeting of the sub circle for instance) :</p><ul><li><strong>4.2.3 (d) Progress Updates:</strong>&nbsp;During this step, the Facilitator asks each participant to highlight progress towards achieving any Project or expressing any Accountability of any of the participant’s Roles in the Circle. Participants may only share progress made since the last report given, and not the general status of a Project or Accountability. Each participant may decide which Projects or Accountabilities are worth reporting on, however if another Circle Member explicitly requested updates on a specific Project, that one must be included until it’s either completed or dropped. F<strong>or progress updates about a Project or Accountability of a Sub-Circle, the Facilitator must allow both the Lead Link and Rep Link of the Sub-Circle the opportunity to share updates.</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And accountability on the Rep Link for “Providing visibility to the Super-Circle into the health of the Sub-Circle, including reporting on any metrics or checklist items assigned to the whole Sub-Circle”.</p>      </div>
