  <dd>How to facilitate 'Open Discussion' before a Proposal</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I wrote this for a client today to clarify how to facilitate the "Open Discussion" space that a Proposer can request before making a proposal in Governance Meetings. Experienced practitioners know it's a "risky" space because it can easily derail into consensus-seeking, or other behaviors attempting to bypass the governance process. So I thought I'd share this with the community. As Facilitator, you want to facilitate Open Discussion by getting as quickly as possible to either a proposal, or...</dd>

<p>Could you publish it once finalised Olivier ? <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Enjoy your trip to Dubaï!</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:455886150941203371]&nbsp;I like it. I know that my guidance above lacks a bit in terms of what the Facilitator should do or say exactly — it's more of a guideline for the participants, and I leave it to the Facilitator&nbsp;to then say the right things to help participants follow these guidelines. So&nbsp;it could be better at telling the Facilitator exactly how to facilitate.</p><p>It's not easy because it's so contextual. That said, the framing of the open discussion by the Facilitator is the one things that's not too contextual, so yeah, I agree with you <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> I'll add something along these lines</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks Olivier! These are great guidelines!</p><p>So far I've not had the situation where the proposer is not able to come up with a basic proposal. They usually have some idea, and I just start with whatever they've got, and the process sorts it out.</p><p>But now I know what to do if they need to get inputs from others to make a proposal. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:449411339497350002]&nbsp;This is very interesting, with inexperienced people &nbsp;I find it &nbsp;very hard to take advantage of&nbsp;the opportunity offered by the Constitution in "present proposal", and then having to cut a discussion that people might feel is bringing somewhere, after all that's all they have been doing before adopting holacracy (discussing), I like your approach I am just not so much at ease with people asking questions about the tension before <strong>clarifying questions</strong> kicks in</p><p>Wouldn't it be safer for the sake of &nbsp;process &nbsp;integrity in case of total lack of creativity by the proposer to do this.</p><p>1) Facilitator to tension holder:"Don't feel forced to make it a good proposal, the purpose of IDM is just that: turn a bad proposal into the best it could become, but if you really have no idea, would you like to request some input from others"?</p><p>Tension holder:"yes"&nbsp;</p><p>2) Facilitator starts a round asking others &nbsp;one by one (no cross talk): "were you in his role, what would you propose?&nbsp;</p><p>others: "no idea | tension makes no sense to me | yes I would do this..."</p><p>as soon as someone proposes &nbsp;something:</p><p>3)facilitator to tension holder: &nbsp;"would you like adopt this as an initial proposal, considering you'll have a chance to amend it later if you wish?"</p><p>4) as soon as proposer says "yes", capture it, interrupt round of opinions and move to clarifying questions (here others may ask questions about the tension and use the answer to better shape their reactions)</p><p>IF proposer never says yes, or none of the others comes up with something, I would probably give one last chance to the tension holder :" if you don't produce at least a starting proposal I am going to have to move on with the agenda" .</p><p>with more experienced people it would probably be easier to have an open discussion and just intervene as facilitator as soon as cliques start to arise around ideas, or people start to impose their view on the proposer. but with beginners I find it very risky.</p><p>&nbsp;I realize this would not &nbsp;really comply with the definition of &nbsp;open discussion.... &nbsp;do you guys think it would be to strict to enforce?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>To sharpen the context even more, you might want to add that the Open Discussion is not meant to place the responsibility for finding a solution back to the group (i.o. not being meant to just chat), as this (to me at least) seems the core: the tensionholder being the one responsible to come up with a solution.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Olivier,</p><p>I'm looking forward to try.</p><p>Sounds like a mixt of :<br />• clarifying questions (IDM step 2)<br />• then clarify and make a starting proposal (kind of IDM Step 4)</p><p>Regards.</p>      </ul>

<p>Love it! The only thing I might add, would be some more explanation of "why" this step is so focused -- especially if people rightly recognize the value of discussion and brainstorming, so they don't understand why this first step is just focused on the proposer.</p><p>So, in those situations, I usually say something like, "this whole process is a form of discussion and brainstorming. So, to get things started, we need to know 'what would YOU like?' Don't pre-filter yourself. And if you're not sure what would solve your tension, no problem, open for discussion now to help you get the starting proposal."</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Olivier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for sharing, I like it a lot.</p><p>I think in your proposer's guideline “State your tension clearly, or explain why you're unclear on it”, I would add: tension=be as specific as you can and bring as many specific cases/examples as you can to illustrate it - remember a tension is a concrete situation that occurred. The more we have real grounded example, the easier it is to get to a starting proposal because we want to address the minimum sufficient to fix&nbsp;the specific issue.</p>      </ul>

<p>Thank you for this Olivier (and Chris). As a beginner facilitator with a fairly somewhat group of practitioners, I think this "process within the process" will help me focus and guide open discussion time towards good proposals a little easier.</p>      </ul>
