      <h4>Definition of Policy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Folks -&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully it's in the mix for next constitution update - but I am continuing to experience tension about the lack of definition for Policy - specifically that part which indicates it cannot require new accountabilities as clearly specified during the HolacracyOne practitioner and coach trainings.</p><p>Does anyone know of a location or document that contains previous definition?</p><p>Without something to point to, any NVGO objection has no teeth - or more specifically in my case, the tension/desire to un-do a handful of Policies that we wrote that require new accountabilities for all circle members.</p><p>Help?</p>    </div>

<p>All helpful, thanks - and not quite what I'm looking for. I do like the Glossary, I refer folks to it a lot, I just wish it said what it cannot be to remove the socialized conflation of the term policy to mean rules that *can* require action. &nbsp;</p><p>If 1.4 is the sole constitution-provided definition of Policy I think it needs greater clarity and expansion re: what a Policy can and cannot do.</p><p>I love the coaching tips and the comparisons - and I get it and got it at Practitioner and then Coach training - I personally know what a Policy 'ought' to be. &nbsp;</p><p>What I don't have is something written - in an official document like the constitution or addendum - and&nbsp;<em>is something&nbsp;concrete that I can point to for justification to strike invalid governance or propose replacement of policies that exceed these informal definitions</em>&nbsp;that says clearly that which all the coaching and comparisons say.</p><p>"Why do we have to replace all these policies (that require action not captured in work agreements, legacy policy or role accountabilities)?"</p><p>&nbsp; - um, because that's not what a policy is supposed to be.</p><p>"Where does it say anywhere that a policy cannot ____ ?"</p><p>&nbsp; - um, well - it doesn't exactly say that anywhere. It's inferred perhaps a little over here in the bit about Authority Over Domains - and if you'd attended either of the trainings you'd have seen a slide that says policies&nbsp;can't require action and heard lots of discussion that said they can't - but it's not explicit in the constitution. Oh - and of course if you were on the CoP you'd see all the smart people agreeing that it's invalid governance."</p><p>Examples of what I'm talking about? &nbsp;Sure, look at how screwed up we are - why not? Somebody made a decision at some point to turn our Glassfrog account public so have a look - I have a nearly endless supply of shame available&nbsp;so why not? Many of the policies at our anchor circle concern me but have a look specifically at&nbsp;these four:</p><p><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/642608" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/642608</a> &nbsp;'will provide'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7802" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7802</a> 'wil contact', '[will] enter their absence'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343</a> 'shall each have' which is understood as 'will provide/is required to provide'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/6856" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/6856</a> 'will each communicate daily'</p><p>All of those items occurred post-adoption or I'd say they could be bundled as legacy policy. &nbsp;Brian suggested @ coach training to work them into a work/employment agreement, have all concerned sign, then strike the governance. &nbsp;That is the tentative plan - but in addition to anchor facilitator trying to audit governance I hope to also coach - and would like more WHY.</p><p>That's why I'm looking for more from the constitution on Policy.</p><p>and yes - maybe I'm intimidated by shadow power structure and trying to socialize a WHY prior to just being a Ferrari and acting on tension</p><p>and, I'm human.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>Have a look at this <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/glossary" target="_blank">Glossary</a>.</p><p>From my perspective, a policy is a kind of "rule of life" adopted within the circle like<br />• "Expenses refund: <em>Expenses will be refund on the 2nd class fare</em>"<br />or<br />• "Clients information update: <em>Clients information has to be updated on the main server".</em></p><p>If you expect a role doing a specific action, then add an accountability to the concerned role(s); i.e.:<br />• Updating clients information</p><p>Hope that helps.

<p>Yo, Keith!</p><p>As Jean-Michel pointed out, Policies affect what authority you have (either by giving you more, putting restrictions on it, or taking it away). A Policy <strong>allows</strong> or <strong>limits</strong> action, while an Accountability <strong>expects</strong> action. Thus, if a Policy is requiring me to do something, it is NVGO.</p><p>So, if a Policy is put into place, it only affects something specific if I choose to take action. A way we normally explain it is that I should never break a Policy if I sit there and do nothing. If a Policy says, "All Circle Members must do X", that is putting an expectation on me and requiring that I do something, thus it would be an invalid Policy.</p><p>On the other hand, Policies can restrict what's allowed, so a Policy could say, "You cannot hold a Role in this Circle unless you do X", because that is technically just restricting my authority. I can normally choose to hold whatever Role I have been put into, but this is limiting that authority by putting some extra restrictions in place. I wouldn't personally recommend this route unless it's 100% necessary for all Roles to do this.</p><p>Simple solution - Ask the Secretary if they think the Policies worded as they are require action/set expectations. If so, it's NVGO. If it's absolutely necessary for everyone in the Circle to be doing that work, create a Role with everyone in the Circle filling it, add it as an Accountability on that Role. If necessary, you can also add a Policy that says, "In order to hold any Role(s) in this Circle, you must also hold the X Role", with X being the aforementioned Role.</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Keith - I'd say it is already explicit in the Constitution; a "Policy" is defined as a grant or limit of authority. &nbsp;Are those things you linked to grants or limits of authority, or something else? &nbsp;If something else, they are&nbsp;definitionally not a "Policy" as the Constitution defines it. &nbsp;You don't need to rely on any instruction or anything else outside of the Constitution to take that stand. &nbsp;You don't even need to say "Policies can't require action" - just that "a Policy is a grant or limit of authority; if this is not one of those two things, it's not valid as a Policy given the definition in the Constitution"...</p><p>And by the way, this one does look like a valid Policy to me (maybe not a good idea, but it is a grant of authority for one circle to&nbsp;cross link into another): &nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343</a></p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Keith - See the definition of Policy in <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art14" target="_blank">§1.4</a> - it's not compatible with a demand that someone definitely&nbsp;go take an action, as that wouldn't meet the definition of a&nbsp;"grant of authority that allows others to control or cause a material impact within a Domain", nor of a "limit on how others may do so when otherwise authorized"...</p>      </div>

<p>Even that rephrasing has questionable validity - I'd argue it's governing the person and not&nbsp;a&nbsp;role or the organization's property. &nbsp;In other words, what gives the organization the right to tell someone they&nbsp;can't leave in the first place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>You could have a policy that says no one may <em>use</em> the office unless they agree to turn off the lights if they're the last one leaving... &nbsp;That's governing the organization's property (the office), not the people, and&nbsp;requiring a voluntary agreement from them if they choose to use the office space.</p>      </div>

<p>So would this be a valid GCC policy?</p><blockquote><p>If you're the last team member to leave the office, you must turn off the TVs.</p></blockquote><p>Or would it need to be phrased like...?</p><blockquote><p>You cannot leave the office until the TVs are off if no other team member is in the office.</p></blockquote><p>It's constraining your authority to normally leave the office as you please.</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Keith - I'd go with option #1, or maybe a slight variation like "No role&nbsp;may assign a partner&nbsp;into roles within&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Lead Operating Circle&nbsp;</em>until that partner has agreed to...". &nbsp;And you're right, that leaves open the question about what happens if current Core Circle Members don't want to agree. &nbsp;But that's reality: if it happens, you'll need to decide what to do about that (e.g. remove them from roles?), and hiding&nbsp;that reality in an NVGO policy statement isn't actually going to make it more likely that people will follow through on the desired agreements... &nbsp;So I'd go with a policy for new members, and then consciously ask the current members to agree to it, knowing that they could say "no", and that would then lead to a question about what to do with that no.&nbsp; These are behavior changes you want, as you point out,&nbsp;and that's got to start with people consciously agreeing to them or&nbsp;the uphill battle is a lot steeper...</p>      </div>

<p>Very interesting and thought-provoking stuff, thank you all.</p><p>The 'policies' in reference are intended as required&nbsp;actions of circle members of our anchor circle - not of all Partners in the part of the org using Holacracy (we're still hybrid and Holacracy still working its way through a predominantly volunteer organization).</p><p>With that understanding of Partner, the only possibilities that I've come up with are each pretty&nbsp;kludgy in different ways.</p><ol><li><strong>New policy</strong>: <em>If a Partner in MKP USA Support Services accepts a position as core circle member of the Lead Operating Circle, that Partner agrees to act in accordance with the LOC Guidelines as detailed here.</em> [link to external doc combining the former policies re: daily messaging, absence calendar, initial response] <ol><li>This seems the easiest to enact but I don't know if it would in itself be NVGO - it has a 'conditional' but might not qualify as valid. AND, then after enacted I think we'd have to each re-accept our membership in the circle... and what if/when one Soul says no? &nbsp;eek.</li></ol></li><li><strong>New Role as LOC Member</strong> - seems simple but has yuck factor, Brian reacted like fingernails on the chalkboard at coach training.&nbsp;<em>Role: LOC&nbsp;Member. Purpose: Reliable engagement and information&nbsp;about partner status and availability. Accountabilities: xxxx</em> [reduxed versions of each of the 'required actions' buried in the NVGO policies.] &nbsp;THEN: Lead Link assigns all current circle members to role LOC Member. <ol><li>Similarly 'easy' in some ways, but seems like an end-run to process somehow - and again couldn't a Soul accept a Role in the circle and be an official 'core circle member' but refuse to accept the LOC member role alongside? eek.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Voluntary Group Agreement</strong> / Work Agreement / Employment Agreement / Volunteer Commitment. To somehow condense these required action into an opt-in agreement - can't easily say it'll become part of employment agreement, b/c LOC is mix of employee and volunteer.&nbsp; <ol><li>This might work? I guess it might seem like a sort of retroactive legacy policy and I haven't figured out that time travel thing. &nbsp;(when I do, I'll let you know yesterday). Being separate from Governance might make it slightly less 'governing the people&nbsp;instead of the property/asset' like in Brian's last comment?</li></ol></li><li><strong>Completely scrap policies and requirements about these things.</strong> Find some other means to <em>encourage/reward/bring about</em>&nbsp;the intents - advance absence planning and recording, availability/status communication (daily) and rapid initial response.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At times, this whole 'fixing out crappy governance' thing seems a bit of a dog-and-pony show. With all the possible 'fixes' above, some Soul could refuse. And then we're back where we (and most humans) are at - with the difficulty / impossibility of changing the behavior of other humans.</p><p>I suppose that's really at the root of all of these controlling behaviors - that some Soul(s) might not do the thing(s) that are expected of them. &nbsp;So a rule is made to point to and say 'look - there - you're supposed to _____ and didn't.'</p><p>Many of these arose due to poor personal/professional communication skills - or a lack of responsible planning regarding absence and travel - and the impact of this on rest of team or individuals within.</p><p>General comments about changing other humans (guffaw) appreciated - but specifically some votes from experts for <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2, 3</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>4</strong>&nbsp;above or some other option not yet conceived.</p><p><em><strong>THANK YOU</strong></em></p>      </div>
