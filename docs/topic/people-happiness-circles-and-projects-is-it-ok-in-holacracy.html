  <dd>People Happiness circles and projects - is it OK in Holacracy?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>In one company I came across a "People Happiness" circle with purpose "Make sure we have happiest team members ever". Expressing that purpose, People Happiness requests projects (actually suggests OKRs) to all other company members considering their happiness and wellness like "Read 5 books this month" or "Visit a gym 8 times this month" or "Stop eating sweets". To my mind it totally contradicts Holacracy ideologically. I'm very curious what you think.</dd>
