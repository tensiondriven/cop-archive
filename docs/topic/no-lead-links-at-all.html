      <h4>No lead links at all?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello there!</p><p>I am trying to implement holacracy in my company (that's me + 2 partners), but we already run a 100% horizontal management in a way it would be difficult to choose a lead link for the anchor circle.</p><p>For a 3-employee organization, that is planning to scale kinda fast from now, what would be the <strong>issues of running holacracy with no lead links</strong> in any circle?&nbsp;</p><p>We have already defined all the roles, but I'm wondering if we'll have trouble in the future without any lead link...</p><p><br />So, I'm searching for some adapted version that can support this structure! Do you guys have any advice? Or this idea might be a bad one?</p>    </div>

<p>[@mention:575944726524854281]. The Lead Link role takes the Strategy as defined in the Super Circle into the Sub-Circle. This way the overal Strategy as defined in the GCC or Anchor Circle is distributed into the Organization. If there are no Lead Links in any Circle then the Accountability needs to be transferred so the Sub-Circles still get the information on Strategy and the priorities that derivate from this.</p><p>How you want to set this up is your choice. If a Role like Strategy Guardian is created this Role will have an Accountability like: "Providing insight about the Company strategy". The Role in the Circle that has been given the Accountability for Establishing priorities then needs to take this information for priority setting. The transferred Accountability from the Lead Link role to this Role then can be something like: Establishing priorities and strategies for the Circle based on input from @Strategy Guardian.</p><p>Here a some links to HolacracyOne and their Strategy process:</p><ul><li><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/66" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/66</a></li><li><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/272" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/272</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Great insight, Tom! Thanks!</p><p>But how about the anchor circle (general company) if I dont have any lead link there, how can I make sure I have a strategy decision making on it with 3 partners with the same power?</p>      </div>

<p>Whatever process you feel comfortable and agree upon as a Policy for it. Can imagine a Policy where 2 out of 3 must agree or all three must agree or ..........</p><p>Do not know if you have focus area's for the 3 partners but than you can use IDM process. The focus holder makes a Strategy Proposal and then use IDM to come to validation of this strategy part.</p><p>Just some thoughts that you can use.</p>      </div>
