  <dd>Hi guys, I thought I'd share this here. This is a survey I created that I send to all my Partners every quarter to assess their opinions of their Role-Fit. I am really curious your opinions on this and suggestions for it. I haven't taken any actions based on responses yet.</dd>

<p>Thank you for sharing Kevin, I really like it. I am curious: how did you make use of the results? Did you create any governance around that process?</p>      </ul>
