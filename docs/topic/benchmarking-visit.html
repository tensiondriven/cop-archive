  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Are there any organizations in, or close to Barcelona that would be interested in hosting a short benchmark visit. A Dubai based organization is sending a few people to a conference soon and would like to visit an organization that has adopted Holacracy during their visit. I can provide more details if there is any interest.</dd>
