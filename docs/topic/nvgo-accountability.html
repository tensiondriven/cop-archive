      <h4>NVGO Accountability?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everybody</p><p>A circle member in our organization added in the previous governance meeting an accountability to his role "Key Account Touchpoint" which is:</p><p>- establishing and energizing the role key account touchpoint</p><p>We are now wondering whether this is just bad governance or actually nvgo? Because this is an expectation towards a rolefiller and not towards a role... And is already a duty of the rolefiller. Any thoughts about that?</p>    </div>

<p>No idea. &nbsp;Here's my best stab at it, if I were Secretary. &nbsp;If the accountability was "Energizing the role X", where X was another role, I would say that it is NVGO. &nbsp;Based on that logic, I would probably say that this is NVGO too.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Artem</p><p>Thank you<img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> - we thought so as well. But it is interesting to think about. Have a nice day</p>      </div>

<p>1. Awesome that circle members are bringing up tensions to process in governance</p><p>2. That specific accountability appears to be a combination of a Project "Establishing a role" and an expectation already in the constitution "Energizing a role" therefore, redundant. Perhaps it's NVGO but I think the clarifying question would be around what exactly is the work that this role is expected&nbsp;to do that serves the purpose of the Circle? My reaction is that the current accountability doesn't provide clarity of the actual work that is expected. How does the role filler "energize" the role. Accountabilities need to be more explicit in order to create clarity.</p>      </div>

<p>Here's Constitution article 1.1 (c):</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>“Accountabilities”</em></strong>, which are ongoing activities of the Organization that the Role will enact</p></blockquote><p>In my interpretation "Energizing Role" is not an ongoing activity of the role, thus this it contradicts with definition of accountability itself, and is an NVGO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
