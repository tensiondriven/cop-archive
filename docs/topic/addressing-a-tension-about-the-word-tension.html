      <h4>Addressing A Tension About The Word "Tension"</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Someone new to our organizational model/process has raised a tension about the word "tension" - they think it's negative and would like us to use a substitute.</p><p>How does the Constitution address this scenario?</p><ul><li>Would it have to be addressed in the anchor circle, or could it be addressed in any given circle as an autonomous choice of that circle?<br /><br /></li><li>I'm assuming it's conceivable that the proposal could be considered valid. In Section 3.2.1, there's mention of a policy that is not really specific to any role, and presumably such a policy would have to come from a valid proposal (where the proposer can articulate how the proposal will enhance the purpose and/or accountabilities of one of their roles). Is that correct? Am I missing something about how generalized proposals are handled?&nbsp;[Reference: "A Circle may also use a Policy to create a time limit for responding to asynchronous Proposals".]<br /><br /></li><li>Would the only way to validly process this tension be to add an accountability to a role (or create a new role with an accountability) of something like "Deciding on which terms we use for tactical &amp; governance meetings"? Or can a proposal&nbsp;somehow be made on this without creating the accountability/authority to make this decision?</li></ul><p><br />Would really appreciate anyone's input! I'm guessing this kind of a corner case scenario, so it seems like an interesting test of the Constitution's comprehensiveness.</p>    </div>

<p>To echo Margaux's point (and dodge the original question <img alt="" class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" />), there's a *really* good reason *not* to change it, especially when someone perceives it as negative and wants to change it... that's exactly the&nbsp;reason for the&nbsp;word tension, to evoke that sense of negatively and dislike, lean into it, and slowly rewire people's meaning-making around&nbsp;that experience itself...</p>      </div>

<p>Gotcha Fred, definitely not Facilitator's place to judge! &nbsp;But it's hard to imagine a valid proposal that will achieve the effect of enforcing a&nbsp;language change. &nbsp;I mean, you can't govern people (only roles), so you can't demand people stop saying a word. &nbsp;You could change the word in the Constitution itself that the company has adopted, but that would take a Ratifier-level constitutional amendment; and even then it's no guarantee people won't still say "tension". &nbsp;You could create an accountability on some role for defining standard terms, sure - but that's still no guarantee people won't say "tension", and they'd have really good reason to as long as the Constitution used the word, whatever that role might decree...</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a funny one because to be valid, a tension has to be based on a specific situation where it limited the person's role.</p><p>I would be curious to see the concrete situation where it limited that new person's role.</p><p>If not, not valid to be processed!</p><p>By the way, “tension” is neutral in its original sense. People often confuse it with problems, negative things which is not. I think you lack pedagogy here - don't avoid that by changing the name, it is a great challenge to continue to use it as is and change people's mind and perception about it.</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for replying so quickly!</p><p>By no means am I eager to use a different term lol, and the irony doesn't escape me.&nbsp;As facilitator though, I'm not weighing in on whether what they say is accurate, but just that he provides a specific, logical example of how it inhibited one of their roles, which he might. To clarify:</p><ul><li>Is it conceivable that this proposal could be considered valid?</li><li>If so, could it result in valid governance output for any circle, or only the overall circle?</li><li>If so, the output can't be changing the term, right? It could only be creating an accountability for a role to decide on terms, right?</li><li>If not (to the first question), then how could a change like this be made? By constitutional amendment by the ratifiers?</li></ul><p>If it comes to it, I want to make sure I have a principled answer for him, and to make sure I don't subvert the process.</p>      </div>

<p>Got it, that's what I figured: constitutional amendment by ratifiers, or new accountability.</p><p>Thanks so much for everyone's feedback.</p>      </div>

<p>Fred,</p><p>I think that it's possible to address this situation through another approach entirely outside of a governance meeting.</p><p>Section 3.4 of the constitution allows a&nbsp;circle's Secretary to interpret the constitution. &nbsp;Any&nbsp;partner can ask the Secretary to rule on the validity of using another word (ex. "broccoli") as substitute for "tension" and the Secretary's interpretation will decide the issue.</p><p>David</p>      </div>
