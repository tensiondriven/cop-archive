      <h4>Does every role have a domain? Confused by Section 1.1</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p><strong>A</strong><em>“Role”</em> is an organizational construct with a descriptive name and one or more of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>(b)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Domains”</em></strong>, which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The way this reads, it sounds like every role should have at least one domain. But I thought it was something optional. Has something changed? Am I misreading this?</p>    </div>

<p>Every Role needs a name, purpose and list of accountabilities but the domain is optional. Mind you each of this could be altered anytime in Governance meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

You want a low barrier for creating a new role, otherwise people will just try to add stuff to the existing roles, which is not what you want.&nbsp;Roles are supposed to be as small and atomic as they can be.</p><p>I think Brian also mentioned that during the CHP training in December.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Fred!</p><p>It says "one or more of the following", meaning that the&nbsp;role can have just one, and not all of these. There might be a role with just an accountability, and no domains or purpose. Or there could be a role with just a domain, and no accountabilities or purpose.</p><p>So the answer is no, role doesn't have to have a domain.</p>      </div>
