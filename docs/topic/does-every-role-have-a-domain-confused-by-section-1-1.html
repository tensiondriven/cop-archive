  <dd>Does every role have a domain? Confused by Section 1.1</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>A “Role” is an organizational construct with a descriptive name and one or more of the following: (b) one or more “Domains” , which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization. The way this reads, it sounds like every role should have at least one domain. But I thought it was something optional. Has something changed? Am I misreading this?</dd>
