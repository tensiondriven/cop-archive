      <h4>Maternity Leave App / Process - Any Ideas?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi friends,</p><p>one of our partners is leaving for maternity leave in 5 weeks and we are looking for a way to adequately reflect this in our organization. The tension is that we do not want to fully remove this partner from our organization and represent her new role of a mother amongst us.</p><p>The operational tasks are pretty clear for us and we will have and old fashioned hand over of projects and tasks.</p><p>The tension is that&nbsp;</p><p>My idea was to remove this partner from all roles as she decided not to energize these especially in the beginning and create a new role in our People Circle: The name of the role could be "EMPAUA-mother" (EMPAUA is our company) with the purpose: "A strong bond with our next generation" and accountabilities still to be discussed.</p><p>How have you solved a similar situation / tension before? THX! :-)</p>    </div>
