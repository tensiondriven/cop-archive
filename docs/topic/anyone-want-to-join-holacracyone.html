  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hey Folks, We're looking for new team members to join HolacracyOne and help us spread a radical new way of organizing power. &nbsp;Know anyone who might be interested? Send them our way! In particular, right now we need someone with a deep background and passion in brand-building/marketing/outreach/PR to help lead our efforts in those areas, within our Outreach Circle . We also really need someone who loves organizing stuff and communicating with people to fill roles like Spokesperson...</dd>

<p>Ah, right - I often forget that detail. &nbsp;We have no location constraints - we're virtual and you can work from anywhere. &nbsp;The only&nbsp;requirement is that you need to be able to travel to the US regularly (about once every other month) for our week-long partner retreats.</p>      </ul>
