      <h4>Compensation tension in governance?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I'm an outside facilitator helping a small business run their first governance meeting in the morning. It's the first time for all of us. The lead link has just&nbsp;initiated a new compensation strategy&nbsp;in which each partner suggests their own monthly retainer rate. One of the partners in the organization has a tension about the compensation strategy. We are pretty sure that the tension doesn't belong in governance, because it's about the partner's personal needs rather than related to her roles. But we're&nbsp;not sure where this tension goes. Can you help? It seems that how we respond to this&nbsp;one tension&nbsp;could&nbsp;be key to showing how the process works and helping create buy-in for Holacracy.</p><p>Thank you!</p>    </div>
