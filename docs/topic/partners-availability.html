      <h4>Partners availability</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi!</p><p>Lead Link of our circle is concerned that some Partners aren't available when they are supposed to. Like Sales person isn't answering incoming calls in the morning. And in general — we feel like it takes too long to get information when it's needed quick.</p><p>In a traditional organisation we could&nbsp;oblige people to stay in the office during the workday. But&nbsp;what can we do in Holacracy&nbsp;to resolve this tension? To me that sounds like a governance issue, but&nbsp;I can't think of a good proposal to make here. Can anybody please help? Have anyone run into similar situation before? What did you do?</p>    </div>

<p>This question is complex so I am not going to cover it all but here are some questions to begin with:</p><p>First question: what is the agreement between coworkers and the organization? Is their something explicite like a work contract or something?</p><p>Then, second question:&nbsp;what role is dealing with partner issues and this type of contracts? Do you have a role for that? If answer is no, then you must define it in governance.</p>      </div>

<p>We made our own evaluation procedure. We have a peer evaluation every 3 months. In small groups (can be a circle) &nbsp;we give each other feedback (what went good,&nbsp;can be improved). The individual makes his / her own self-reflection and compares it in the group with the feedback&nbsp;from the&nbsp;other circle members. And tells the group what he&nbsp;/ she will do with it and how it fits with the self-relfection. The individual can make projects and write in Glassfrog or capture it in an other way</p>      </div>
