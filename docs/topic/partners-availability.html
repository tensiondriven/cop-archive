  <dd>Partners availability</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi! Lead Link of our circle is concerned that some Partners aren't available when they are supposed to. Like Sales person isn't answering incoming calls in the morning. And in general â€” we feel like it takes too long to get information when it's needed quick. In a traditional organisation we could oblige people to stay in the office during the workday. But what can we do in Holacracy to resolve this tension? To me that sounds like a governance issue, but I can't think of a good proposal to...</dd>

<p>This question is complex so I am not going to cover it all but here are some questions to begin with:</p><p>First question: what is the agreement between coworkers and the organization? Is their something explicite like a work contract or something?</p><p>Then, second question:&nbsp;what role is dealing with partner issues and this type of contracts? Do you have a role for that? If answer is no, then you must define it in governance.</p>      </ul>

<p>This is an interesting topic. We resolved it with peer evaluations. We decided in the governance meeting upon a procedure how to do this evaluation and what to do with the results.&nbsp; I don't know if this is according to the holacracy rules, but it works. Does this help you?</p>      </ul>

<p>We made our own evaluation procedure. We have a peer evaluation every 3 months. In small groups (can be a circle) &nbsp;we give each other feedback (what went good,&nbsp;can be improved). The individual makes his / her own self-reflection and compares it in the group with the feedback&nbsp;from the&nbsp;other circle members. And tells the group what he&nbsp;/ she will do with it and how it fits with the self-relfection. The individual can make projects and write in Glassfrog or capture it in an other way</p>      </ul>

<p>Christel,</p><p>thanks for explanation. I think it might solve the problem for us, though maybe it will take some time.</p>      </ul>
