  <dd>Facilitator Deleting Checklist Items?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>As Facilitator of a circle, I noticed that there are checklist items which don't correspond to accountabilities. Am I overstepping by deleting them / should only the Secretary edit the checklist? Or is that permissible as Facilitator? Also, if the Secretary doesn't agree -- but it's self-evident that they don't match -- what recourse would the Facilitator or another role have? Thoughts?</dd>
