<p>Who uses both Holacracy and Rockefeller Habits? I have seen great integration between the two approaches. And have two clients that both apply&nbsp;the two methodologies to their strenghts. Let me know if you use both methodologies already and want to join this conversation and explore further how Rockefeller Habits and Holacracy strengthen each other.</p>    </div>

<p>I think there is a lot&nbsp;more compatibility between Holacracy and other systems of working than is generally given credit to - but it requires Holacracy to be something that you use in pursuit of a clear and broader goal, rather than the goal in itself. IE yes they may "ideologically contradict" - but I don't know if I really care about the ideology of Holacracy (while at the same time finding it a very very useful suite of tools).</p>      </div>

<p>From my&nbsp;perspective, there is no "ideology of Holacracy" - it's just a framework of rules, no more.</p>      </div>

<p>The Rockafeller Habits come from an author named Verne Harnish (2002). He's more of the Peter Drucker School of helping hierarchy live with itself but has some very useful tips. Here&nbsp;you go:&nbsp;</p><p>1. <a href="https://gazelles.com/static/resources/tools/en/RH_Checklist.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Habits List&nbsp;</a></p><p>2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verne_Harnish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Verne Harnish Wiki</a></p><p>Springest.nl&nbsp;is definitely&nbsp;using OKRs and has a "BGAH" (big hairy audacious goal) and maybe daily standups. Ruben would be good to talk to here.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't know it I recommend looking at something a VIISI employee (Marc-Peter) introduced me to which is running Holacracy with the "<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eisenhower Matrix"</a></strong>. It's very <a href="https://www2.usgs.gov/humancapital/documents/TimeManagementGrid.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stephen Covey</a>&nbsp;and has helped our team on a weekly basis with our A over B over C prioritization for Lead Link Heuristics and standups.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I dived into "Scaling Up" and like a lot of the ideas shared within. But as&nbsp;already stated, I think Holacracy and Rockefeller Habbits do contradict each other in some ways. I labelled the Rockefeller Habbits as best way to do traditional management.</p><p>I am very curious how to add many of the good ideas to holacracy, ideally as real world examples <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>

<p>its true that&nbsp;Scaling up is written to work in a traditional hierarchy. but when applied within a holarchy they work out really well. it just requires changing any reference to "executive team" to something like "leader" or "circle" and suddently it all makes a lot more sense.</p><p>Viisi and Presenter for example are&nbsp;doing Rockefeller habits and applying Holacracy together with ease.</p><p>just like googles OKR approach works well both under traditional management and holacracy.</p>      </div>

<p>Our company is using some of "Scaling Up" approaches like BHAGs and quaterly themes. I hardly see how it combines with Holacracy (I rather see how it ideologically contradicts). Would love to know more about combination of them.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Agree with&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;Holacracy is just a framework, *neutral* - there are a lot of misunderstanding &amp; confusion around that on the market with teal org. and "entreprise libérée" philosophy. I just had a conversation with a CEO taht&nbsp;was afraid of things that it thought should be required by Holacracy, which is absolutely not the case. The business and process content is still designed by those who run the business - no philosophy to absorb here as pre req.</p>      </div>
