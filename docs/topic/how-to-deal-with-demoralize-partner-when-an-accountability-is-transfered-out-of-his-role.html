  <dd>How to deal with demoralize partner when an accountability is transfered out of his role?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Consider the following scenario: In our tech circle, there is internal tech role, whose accountability is developing and maintaining order tools, And then, there is another role, store tech role, whose accountability is developing and maintaining tools for store daily operations. One of the store operation is to create orders. Previously, store tools will send order data to internal tools, but then recently this integration was experiencing issues causing missing order among other things.</dd>
