  <dd>Secretarial Cleanups of Governance Records</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I thought that the constitution provides for the Secretary to regularly edit the governance records for style, punctuation, and grammar, as well as clerical errors so long as he or she doesn't change the substance of the governance at question. I can't seem to find that in the Constitution. Can someone point me in the right direction?</dd>
