      <h4>Lead Link and Rep Link in the Constitution</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi!</p><p>I am confused right now about how the Lead Link and Rep Link are defined in the Constitution!</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rep Link</span></p><p>Looking at "2.3.1 BASE MEMBERSHIP" -&nbsp;it seems the&nbsp;Rep Link is only a (core) role within the (super-)circle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to which</span>&nbsp;it is elected,&nbsp;and not in the (sub-)circle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in which</span>&nbsp;it is elected. Is that true?</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 8"><p><code>2.3.1 BASE MEMBERSHIP</code></p><p><code>Unless a special appointment or exclusion is made under the terms of this section, the Core Circle Members of a Circle are:</code></p><p><code>(a) each Partner filling a Defined Role in the Circle;</code><br /> <code>(b) the Lead Link of the Circle, as defined in Section 2.2;</code><br /> <code>(c) each Rep Link elected to the Circle, as defined in Section 2.6.4; (d) and each Cross Link into the Circle, as defined in Section 2.7</code></p></div><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lead Link</span></p><p>In the Holacracy book (and H1 training), we're told that the Lead Link is in the super-circle - and indeed GlassFrog represents it this way. But I cannot find anything in the constitution that says this.</p><p>I guess it's some kind of interaction between "2.1&nbsp;CIRCLE BASICS"...</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 6"><p><code>A “Circle” is a Role that may further break itself down by defining its own contained Roles to achieve its Purpose, control its Domains, and enact its Accountabilities.</code></p></div><p>and&nbsp;"2.2.1 HOLDS UNDIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONS"...</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 6"><p><code>A Circle’s Lead Link inherits the Purpose and any Accountabilities on the Circle itself, and controls any Domains defined on the Circle, just as if the Circle were only a Role and the Lead Link filled that Role.</code></p></div><p>But then I have also had several much more experienced Holacracy practitioners tell me today that the <em>"Lead Link role does not exist in the super-circle; the Lead Link exists within the (sub-)circle. In the super-circle, there is only the role, which is filled by the role-holder of the Lead Link role within the sub-circle"</em>. IE that these are different <span style="text-decoration: underline;">roles</span> - and that the Lead Link therefore cannot be said to process tensions in the super-circle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I find this really confusing - is there something that I'm missing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, Andrew&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Andrew, interesting question! I'll take a stab at it.</p><p>Regarding the Rep Link, I think it may be an issue of English prepositional interpretation ("<strong>of</strong> the circle" "<strong>to</strong> the circle", and "<strong>in</strong> the circle").&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it says, "each Rep Link elected <strong>to</strong> the Circle," but the context of this is regarding "base membership" of&nbsp;one specific Circle. So, I think it's fair to interpret that "to" as appropriate regarding an elected Role (as in, "people are elected <strong>to</strong> an office" not "of an office" or "for an office") for the entity they represent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the Lead Link and whether&nbsp;or not it's "in" the Super-Circle. I think you're right that section 2.2.1 helps clarify that the Lead Link of a Sub-Circle (say "Marketing") is also the Role of that Sub-Circle in its entirety (i.e. the "Role of Marketing") from the perspective of the Super-Circle.</p><p>In addition to that, which I admit isn't&nbsp;super clear, I think the interpretation comes from connecting two different parts of the Constitution; 1) the guidance around the Lead Link of a Circle; and 2) what is a Role and how it works within a Circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Meaning, since the Lead Link inherits the purpose and accountabilities of a Circle, and that Circle is really just a Role (from the perspective of the Super-Circle), then the Lead Link is the defacto "Marketing Role" in the Super-Circle.</p><p>It's like looking at two sides of the same coin.&nbsp;One side has an image of a flag, the other side a river. Depending on <em>how</em> you look at it (<em>from what</em> perspective), does the coin feature a flag or river? Well, both. It's the same entity, just looked at in two different ways.</p><p>Meaning, it's 100% accurate to say "the 'Lead Link'&nbsp;doesn't exist in the Super-Circle," because the "Marketing Role" exists in the Super-Circle. But in a way, it's the same entity. So, it's <em>also</em> accurate to say "The Lead Link does exist<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the Super-Circle." That may be where there is some confusion.</p><p>Of course, none of this means the Constitution itself shouldn't be clarified, so consider <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitting something about it to Github</a>.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;Chris!</p><p>This two sides of a coin interpretation matches my view of how the LL is in the super-circle and the sub-circle.</p><p>The Rep Link stuff I'm still confused by - one for the feature list! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Thanks, Andrew&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>In sociocracy both lead links and rep links are in the super-circle. However i met some persons practising holacracy in their company that consider the rep link take the seat from the lead link in the super-circle which could make sense as well. I am wondering which are the pros and cons for the two perspectives.</p>      </div>
