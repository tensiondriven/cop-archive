  <dd>Attention Point App</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Policy to Adopt: This policy defines a new type of currency for the organization, called "Attention Points" (or AP's for short). Attention Points will ultimately get allocated to a role, to "fund" the role with partner attention. A role allocated 100 Attention Points indicates the ideal attention for that role equals one full-focus partner in total; 200 AP's means the ideal attention is that of two full-focus partners, while 50 means the ideal is half of a full-focus partner's attention.

<p>Hi everybody!</p><p>I do not see the usefulness in these Attention Points and thus have a question.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: #d8d8d8;">'Only the Lead Link of the circle adopting this policy may create new Attention Points, and once created they become a resource of the circle, similar to a cash budget'<br /></span></p><p><em><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How Lead Link can understand and define, how many attention points should be addressed to the particular Role or Project?&nbsp;</span></em> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">This App Description has nothing about the algorithm of defining exact APs for Roles/Projects.&nbsp;<br /></span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I think, this is very specific and almost impossible to identify by one person and is possible to identify only based on the experience of the Role's/Project's performer.<br /></span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">So what is the sense of this App, if we can not correctly enough calculate APs?</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Gregory,</p><p>If I may,</p><p>The Lead Link, by default, is accountable for "Allocating the Circle’s resources across its various Projects and/or Roles". In that matter, this App does not change that. If your tension is "This resource allocation on Roles/Project cannot be done by only one person..." then you may want to propose in governance a different way of doing it and then removing this accountability from the Lead Link.</p><p>My understanding of this App is just a way of doing this allocation by creating a more tangible scale on the attention partners should put&nbsp;while&nbsp;energizing a role. So for instance the LL allocates 20 Attention Points to Role A. So Partner X energizing role A should not&nbsp;dedicate more than 20% of his focus to it (my assumption here would be that 100 AP = 1 FTE).</p><p>So if you're still interested by this App, but don't want the LL to decide about AP allocation, maybe you should first transfer Resource allocation accountability to a different process, and update accordingly this App.</p><p>Did I help a bit ?</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:491495232183315418], thank you for the answer! Believe, I clearly understand your point of view.</p><p>You've told:</p><p><em><span style="background-color: #d8d8d8;">My understanding of this App is just a way of doing this allocation by creating a more tangible scale on the attention partners should put&nbsp;while&nbsp;energizing a role. So for instance the LL allocates 20 Attention Points to Role A. So Partner X energizing role A should not&nbsp;dedicate more than 20% of his focus to it (my assumption here would be that 100 AP = 1 FTE).</span></em></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I would like to disagree with you. LL may understand how much time the Partner needs to spend on each Role, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but one Partner is involved in different Circles with different LLs</span>, you see? LL can not see the picture from the view of a Partner. I would even say that the LL acts as a manager of the Partner, because he/she says to the Partner how long he/she has to accomplish the Role.<br /></span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Are you sure, that you understand Attention Points right?</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I think, I have better way to organise attention of the partners onto the Projects and Next Actions.</span></span> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The idea is each partner of the company has own Kanban board, where all his/her Next Actions and Projects are located <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the prioritised way</span></span>. All means the projects from all Roles the partner holds.</p><p>The prioritisation of the Next Actions and Projects is done according to some coefficient. For example, <u>the ratio of the ‘percentage of already done tasks (in hours)’ to the ‘percentage of already spent time (in hours)’</u>. It requires each project and next action to have:</p><ul><li>Defined start date;</li><li>Defined deadline;</li><li>Either estimated time for each task of the project (or next action) or automatically calculated average time for one task from the experience.</li></ul><p><span style="color: #a5a5a5;">*Task means either a Next Action or one of actions in a Project.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Actually, do you know how the Attention Points are used by H1? Maybe we both understand them wrong. For now I still see no need in them.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Kind regards,<br />Georgiy.</span></p>      </ul>
