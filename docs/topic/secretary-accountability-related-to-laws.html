      <h4>Secretary accountability related to laws</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row">
TLDR: the secretary accountability: "Interpreting Governance and the Constitution upon request" can be extend to interpret also the laws or is it necessary to create a new role with accountability to check and deliver interpretation about some laws and regulations? Example: In a practice session we encountered 2 objections to a proposal regarding modifying a policy. Both objections comes as "Illegal" from affected roles so they were pass the questions test. The problem is that each objection...    </div>

<p>Hi, Andrei:</p><p>A little side observation:</p><p>Dropping a proposal can only happen if the original proposer decides to do that, it can not be done just because objections are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>In the integration round, the objector has to come up with a counter proposal that will still address the original proposer's tension. &nbsp;If the counter proposal is not good enough, then the proposer will need to, again, counter with a different proposal. &nbsp;This goes back and forth until a proposal that's "safe and good enough to try" is found.</p><p>In your example, perhaps, one approach is to ask why the proposer needed to relax the requirement and then try to solve that a different way, i.e. other than by changing the threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I would make a new role. The same person could hold it if you like, but it all stays clear (as one of the Holacracy goal is). I'd love to read more professional answers about that <img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/snowman.gif" title="xsman" /></p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353],</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal was dropped by the Proposer. It was very difficult for Objector to come up with a counter proposal because the Tension was to reduce the number of invoices you need to bring after you spent company money. And this is imposed by the law .</p><p>The process was followed. The question was if we can extend the "Governance" from the Secretary accountabilities to any other governance the company has to follow but is not internally generated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Andrei</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Andrei,</p><p>Accountability of the Secretary is "<em>Interpreting Governance and the Constitution upon request</em>", not interpreting some laws and regulations...</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
