      <h4>Lead Link and Circle resources</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>We have recently bumped into an apparent inconsistency that we'd like to get some clarification on.</p><p>GlassFrog Habit #4 has the following statement in it:</p><blockquote><p>You can't buy a new computer without Lead Link approval. Lead Links have the power to allocate resources.</p></blockquote><p>We understand that the Lead Link has the following accountability:</p><blockquote><p>Allocating the Circle’s resources across its various Projects and/or Roles</p></blockquote><p>However, to disallow others from access to the circle's resources, wouldn't that need to be a&nbsp;<em>domain</em> on the Lead Link--not just an accountability? &nbsp;I would have assumed that any resource allocated to the circle by the organization would be an implied domain and therefore accessible to any Role in the Circle (2.1.2).</p><p>Clearly, there's something here we don't understand correctly. &nbsp;Can someone help us?</p><p>Geoff</p>    </div>
