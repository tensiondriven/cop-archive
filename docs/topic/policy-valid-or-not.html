      <h4>Policy Valid or Not</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi.</p><p>We are practicing Holacracy for 5 month now, one circle, 10 members.</p><p>Recently we had few new Policies for GCC, and I feel they are not valid, but I am not able to proof it.</p><p>They look to me too detailed to be a "Policy" - i know this is not a good reason to object, but I would like to ask you for your oppinion:</p><p>Examples of the Policies are as follows:</p><p>- There should be no private packages orederd and delivered to the company office. (for safety and work efficiency reason)</p><p>- There should be no eating outside the canteen.</p><p>- Person using company car, in case of accident, or any other damage, is responsible to contact insurance company directly.</p><p>- Payments are made every week on Thursday</p><p>Some of the Policies are kind of copy of existing, old rules, and some of them are not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let me know your oppinion.</p><p>Regards</p>    </div>
