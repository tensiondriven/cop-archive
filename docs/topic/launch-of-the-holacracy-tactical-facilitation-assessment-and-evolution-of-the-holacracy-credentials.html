      <h4>Launch of the Holacracy Tactical Facilitation Assessment &amp; evolution of the Holacracy credentials.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row">
I am pleased to announce that today HolacracyOne launches a brand new Tactical Facilitation Assessment! The Tactical Assessment is two things: a gauge of Holacracy facilitation and coaching skills during tactical meetings; and also a learning tool which fills a gap our public trainings are not designed to satisfy. You can book here . This is part of the evolution of the credentials, and so from today, any person who does not yet hold a Certified Holacracy Facilitator or Coach credential will...    </div>

<div>Yes [@mention:456308404254624012], that’s correct: Tactical + Governance Assessments are $1,790 in total.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>And HolacracyOne wants to support licensees and make the transition easier for those who are actively doing substantial amounts of Holacracy work in the world. So we offer free credits to take the new&nbsp;Tactical Assessment to&nbsp;licensees who deliver at least a certain volume of&nbsp;Holacracy work each year. Details are in&nbsp;the Licensee Forum slack channel on the&nbsp;Holacracy Provider workspace that you are a member of.&nbsp;</div>      </div>

<p>[@mention:450960215289659578] . Question to prepare for the assessment. Is there a Glassfrog environment available where we can see the current initial structure that has been defined by Jan and Susan (as we could for the Governance assessment)</p><p>We have this question from the coaches in the Online Practice Group&nbsp;[@mention:486850353354280140],&nbsp;[@mention:550748956283466295],&nbsp;[@mention:577352400502155145],&nbsp;[@mention:573692591169355705],&nbsp;[@mention:524570332260749435],&nbsp;[@mention:548355922639373031]</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for your question&nbsp;[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;and&nbsp;it’s good to see peer support in preparing for the&nbsp;Tactical Assessment!</p><p>This is just a quick note to let you know that&nbsp;I am processing your request and will respond here as soon as&nbsp;I can.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge we are facing is that it’s not realistic for people to have weeks to pour over GlassFrog data for a meeting they are about to facilitate with a new group because in reality a coach would rarely have this opportunity, and we are trying to make&nbsp;assessment as close to real-life conditions as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The test is based on “how would an experienced coach handle this situation?”; and not having much time to prepare is realistic.</p>      </div>

I've updated&nbsp;the guidance on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/get-ready-for-the-tactical-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relevant webpage</a> to clarify this.&nbsp;</p><p>And to protect the integrity of the&nbsp;assessment we ask that these records are not shared with anyone else, as this would compromise the&nbsp;assessment for future candidates for the reasons given above.&nbsp;</p><p>Do let me know if you have any more questions or if&nbsp;I can be of assistance in any other way. I look forward to seeing some of you in your&nbsp;assessments!&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes, Nick&nbsp;</p>      </div>
