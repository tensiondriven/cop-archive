      <h4>Launch of the Holacracy Tactical Facilitation Assessment &amp; evolution of the Holacracy credentials.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am pleased to announce that today HolacracyOne launches a brand new Tactical Facilitation Assessment!</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tactical Assessment is two things: a&nbsp;gauge&nbsp;of Holacracy facilitation and coaching skills during tactical meetings; and also a learning tool which fills a gap our public trainings are not designed to satisfy.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You can <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.holacracy.org/facilitation-assessment" target="_blank">book here</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of the evolution of the credentials,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and so from today, any person who does not yet hold a Certified Holacracy Facilitator or Coach credential will be required to pass</span> <strong>both</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Tactical and Governance Assessment, at the required score to earn a credential. Here’s some of the background and context:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holacracy has grown and matured significantly across the world in the last few years. There are now 82 Certified Holacracy Coaches, 41 Certified Holacracy Facilitators, licensees working in over 11 countries, over 1,500 graduates of Holacracy Practitioner trainings, trademarks registered in 32 countries (paving the way for inroads to China, Russia, Brazil, the UAE and more), and translations of the Holacracy book in 14 languages! We are encouraged by the growth and grateful to already certified&nbsp;individuals and the wider community for your contributions to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Holacracy evolves, the needs of the market have become more sophisticated and we are seeing the need to mature the certification methods as well, which need to offer clearer distinctions between different types and levels of skill. Previously, earning a Certified Holacracy credential required passing a Governance Assessment only. Testing only Governance facilitation and coaching skills, however, and proved insufficient to accurately&nbsp;appraise&nbsp;the broader set of skills needed to effectively coach or lead a whole Holacracy adoption. So the credential needed to expand to assess tactical facilitation skills as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tactical Assessment is similar to the Governance Assessment in format, is virtual and delivered live by two trained Certified Holacracy Coaches; you can read more details</span> <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/get-ready-for-the-tactical-assessment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you still have questions, you can add them to this thread and I will be pleased to answer them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/9634504" target="_blank">Certification Program Manager</a> for HolacracyOne</span></p>    </div>

<div>Yes [@mention:456308404254624012], that’s correct: Tactical + Governance Assessments are $1,790 in total.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>And HolacracyOne wants to support licensees and make the transition easier for those who are actively doing substantial amounts of Holacracy work in the world. So we offer free credits to take the new&nbsp;Tactical Assessment to&nbsp;licensees who deliver at least a certain volume of&nbsp;Holacracy work each year. Details are in&nbsp;the Licensee Forum slack channel on the&nbsp;Holacracy Provider workspace that you are a member of.&nbsp;</div>      </div>

<p>[@mention:450960215289659578] . Question to prepare for the assessment. Is there a Glassfrog environment available where we can see the current initial structure that has been defined by Jan and Susan (as we could for the Governance assessment)</p><p>We have this question from the coaches in the Online Practice Group&nbsp;[@mention:486850353354280140],&nbsp;[@mention:550748956283466295],&nbsp;[@mention:577352400502155145],&nbsp;[@mention:573692591169355705],&nbsp;[@mention:524570332260749435],&nbsp;[@mention:548355922639373031]</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for your question&nbsp;[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;and&nbsp;it’s good to see peer support in preparing for the&nbsp;Tactical Assessment!</p><p>This is just a quick note to let you know that&nbsp;I am processing your request and will respond here as soon as&nbsp;I can.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge we are facing is that it’s not realistic for people to have weeks to pour over GlassFrog data for a meeting they are about to facilitate with a new group because in reality a coach would rarely have this opportunity, and we are trying to make&nbsp;assessment as close to real-life conditions as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The test is based on “how would an experienced coach handle this situation?”; and not having much time to prepare is realistic.</p>      </div>
