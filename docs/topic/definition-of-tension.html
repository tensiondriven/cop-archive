      <h4>Definition of "tension"</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi.</p><p>In the Constitution definition of "Tension" is pretty clear:</p><p>(...) You are responsible for monitoring how your Role’s Purpose and<br />Accountabilities are expressed, and comparing that to your vision of their<br />ideal potential expression, to identify gaps between the current reality and<br />a potential you sense (each gap is a “Tension”). (...)</p><p>But as far as I understand the word "to express" - this tension relates to the the "governance tensions" - is that correct? - If you check how it is "expressed" meaning "described" then you discuss about your Role description?</p><p>How about so called "tactical tensions" - I understand them, we use them, but I don't think they are really described in the Constitution?</p><p>Any comments?</p><p>Warmly,&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Mikolaj, every&nbsp;gap between the current reality and a potential you sense is a Tension. In the Tactical meeting (art 4.2.3(e)) you see that we triage the Tensions that are on the agenda that has been build.</p><p>You can express a Tension that is Tactical that comes from an Accountability of one of your roles (Governance).</p><p>For example: in my role "Speechmaker", where I have the Accountability to represent the organization and talk about Holacracy,&nbsp; I have the Tension that often their is no good sound installation on the venue's where I come. Therefore I want a Next action from the Role "Stuff we Need" to buy a portable speaker set for me.</p><p>So in both Tactical as Governance we process Tensions but also outside of these meetings you can express and process Tensions with other Roles.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>      </div>

<p>I have posted this question few months ago, then I thought it was clear, but now it is again unclear for me <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>We do the study of Constitution in our organisation and we had a huge discussion about defnition of "Tension".</p><p>As far as I undestand in Constitution there is no "definition of tension" - in 1.2.1 is described the situation when your role descritption is not as good as it could be and then it is mentioned that this situation is a "Tension"</p><p>In other words - "that is an example of a Tension" - but this is not definition - am I correct? (In 4.2.3(e) word "tension" is used, but again it is not defined)</p><p>It is not mentioned anywere else that any difference between actual and ideal is a tension - it looks like we take word that was used in discussion about role description and we use it for any "un-ideal" situation.</p><p>That is my understanding - any comment that can make it clearer? <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>

<p>Mikolaj, what 1.2.1 states is the definition of a Tension: A gap between current reality and a potential you sense, and where each gap is a Tension.</p><p>Maybe the Holacracy Wiki helps you with the definitions: <a href="http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Tension" target="_blank">http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Tension</a></p>      </div>
