      <h4>When objections pop up at reaction round</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>There it went again: during a reaction round to&nbsp;a governance change proposal,&nbsp;a person stated "I object already".<br /><br />I&nbsp;feel like one should not state this nor variants like "I will object" during the reaction round. I&nbsp;feel&nbsp;it is not the right posture for this very precise moment of the IDP. It is not the part of our intelligence that the process asks us to give at this moment.<br /><br />And it has lasting impacts. Stating it moves the minds around the table (including the one of the proposer) already into objection round.&nbsp;It also puts a threat on the proposer, and an emphasis on this very reaction, like some hard push to consider it and amend the proposal accordingly.<br /><br />For the reacter, allowing themselves to do so is not giving their best. react with their heart and soul, but refrain from thinking the objection yet.&nbsp;<br /><br />I even wonder if it shouldn’t be explicitly forbidden.<br /><br />Gut feelings more than well structured thoughts on this.<br />Any opinions?</p>    </div>
