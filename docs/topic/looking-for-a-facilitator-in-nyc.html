<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:550185852389690415], this is great to hear about your charter in NYC! I'm with HolacracyOne and we've been communicating with the Wildflower Foundation in the past. I believe I can help, if anything to help you figure out what would be the most appropriate&nbsp;support for your situation, even if you don't use us for the support <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> Want to send me an email at olivier at holacracyone.com? We can set up a call&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:550185852389690415]&nbsp;I'd be pleased to provide pro bono facilitation and coaching over Zoom (I'm in Canada) if it would help. I do both roles extensively within my own organization where I have the role of "Holacracy Coach" and also serve as an introductory Facilitator until circles are ready to self-facilitate.</p>      </div>
