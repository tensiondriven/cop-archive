<p>I'm making the first steps toward implementing Holacracy in our organization: a small national sports federation located in Veenendaal. In December our team is going to prepare the initial Defined Roles and starting from January we will introduce weekly Tactical and Governance Meetings. Once we're on our way it could be very interesting to meet face to face to share experiences.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Christel, you can always visit one of our Holacracy Safari's in Amsterdam and we can have a chat afterwards too. We do charge €50 for it, to buy fun office gadgets since we all invest in this, and to make sure the visitors are engaged and really interested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.springest.nl/springest-academy/holacracy-safari-live-tactical-at-springest" target="_blank">https://www.springest.nl/sprin...actical-at-springest</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And as said, there are meetups coming up again too, we're in touch with HolacracyOne again to host them at Springest.a</p>      </div>
