      <h4>Strategy and priorities</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a maybe naive question :</p><p>The Constitution mention what we can expect from the Lead Link of a circle in terms of defining relative priorities and strategy (2.2.2).</p><p>But I don't find where the Constitution says that :</p><p>A. the members of the circle must align on those priorities and strategy (which explicit rule says we can expect them to do so ?)</p><p>B. no other role in the circle can for example define a strategy for the circle (a rule which says there is a domain about strategy ?).</p><p>Thanks you for your help !</p><p>Vincent</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p><p>The circle may decide to create a "Strategy role" and delegate the Lead Link strategy authority to this "Strategy role" by adopting a policy on purpose.<br />Hope that helps :-))</p><p>Warm regards,<br />Jean-Michel</p><p>2.2.3 AMENDING THE LEAD LINK ROLE<br />A Circle may not add Accountabilities or other functions to its own Lead<br />Link Role, or modify the Role’s Purpose, or remove the Role entirely.<br />However, a Circle may remove any Accountabilities, Domains, authorities,<br />or functions of its Lead Link Role, either by placing them on another Role<br />within the Circle, or by defining an alternate means of enacting them.<br />When this occurs, it automatically removes the relevant element or<br />authority from the Lead Link Role, for as long as the delegation remains in<br />place.</p>      </div>

<p>Maybe my idea is naive too, but as a Lead Link, can't you just have a good talk to members of the circle which don't "obey" the strategy ("As a Lead Link I doubt your role fit is good since you lack to follow the strategy").&nbsp;</p><p>A bit harsh perhaps, but in the end the Lead Link should guide all circle members to pursuit the circles purpose.</p><p>Btw, in most circles I participate the Lead Link sets strategies together with all circle members to sense tensions and to increase acceptance (team effort instead of one man / woman show). Works well&nbsp;</p>      </div>
