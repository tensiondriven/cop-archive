  <dd>Hello, I have a maybe naive question : The Constitution mention what we can expect from the Lead Link of a circle in terms of defining relative priorities and strategy (2.2.2). But I don't find where the Constitution says that : A. the members of the circle must align on those priorities and strategy (which explicit rule says we can expect them to do so ?) B. no other role in the circle can for example define a strategy for the circle (a rule which says there is a domain about strategy ?).</dd>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p><p>The circle may decide to create a "Strategy role" and delegate the Lead Link strategy authority to this "Strategy role" by adopting a policy on purpose.<br />Hope that helps :-))</p><p>Warm regards,<br />Jean-Michel</p><p>2.2.3 AMENDING THE LEAD LINK ROLE<br />A Circle may not add Accountabilities or other functions to its own Lead<br />Link Role, or modify the Role’s Purpose, or remove the Role entirely.<br />However, a Circle may remove any Accountabilities, Domains, authorities,<br />or functions of its Lead Link Role, either by placing them on another Role<br />within the Circle, or by defining an alternate means of enacting them.<br />When this occurs, it automatically removes the relevant element or<br />authority from the Lead Link Role, for as long as the delegation remains in<br />place.</p>      </ul>

<p>Maybe my idea is naive too, but as a Lead Link, can't you just have a good talk to members of the circle which don't "obey" the strategy ("As a Lead Link I doubt your role fit is good since you lack to follow the strategy").&nbsp;</p><p>A bit harsh perhaps, but in the end the Lead Link should guide all circle members to pursuit the circles purpose.</p><p>Btw, in most circles I participate the Lead Link sets strategies together with all circle members to sense tensions and to increase acceptance (team effort instead of one man / woman show). Works well&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
