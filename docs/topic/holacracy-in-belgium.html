      <h4>Holacracy in Belgium</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi again,</p><p>After a break of about 2 years, happy to be fully into Holacracy&nbsp; as a supporting system for organisational development again.</p><p>With the renewed energy after the Coach Training of 4-8 March in Amsterdam, the positive entrepreneurial energy of Fabian and the support of Diederick and Energized, we will spread the word on Holacracy in Belgium for the next few months.</p><p>A lot of Belgian organisations are trying to practice self-organisations, but only very rarely they decide fully to change the underlaying powerstructures. Looking forward to our journey and how this wil evolve.</p><p>The first airplay was created on national Radio and News, in a positive en respectfull way. <a href="http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/economie/1.2598267" target="_blank">http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/economie/1.2598267</a></p><p>on 17th of March, Diederick came to Antwerp to give some food for thought to the first group of want-to-know-more boyz&amp;girlz. we created a positive vibe and showed in which ways Holacracy could be helpfull in their quests...</p><p>All best practices for these early steps in spreading the word are most welcome!</p><p>Anyone who would like to participate in these early steps, please get in touch <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hendrik</p>    </div>
