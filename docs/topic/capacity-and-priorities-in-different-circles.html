<p>Hi All,</p><p>My question is if someone knows how you set priorities if 1 person has different roles in different circles and when capacity of this person is probably not enough (not enough time for both roles) and the work has to be done f.e. for a client.</p><p>Thanks for your response :-)</p><p>Christel</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>I don't see how that could be answered within Holacracy: It's up to John how to resolve his tension - ultimately a completely personal decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Or, to answer your question: I don't think he "should" do anything special, besides sensing and processing the tensions and staying transparent to fellow circles members (4.1.1. b in the constitution comes to mind).)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interested if others have a different view.</p>      </div>

<p>Christel,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I understand you correctly, it is up to the Lead Link of the Super-Circle (the one including both circles) to set a relative priority for a specific project.

I 'm not waiting for someone to set priorities. But you made the confusion in my head&nbsp;more clear for me. :-) I suggest the situation in which a lead link in circle A sets priorities and a lead link in circle B sets priorities. A person, f.e. John, is fulfilling a role in circle A and a role in circle B. John is asked by both lead links to prioritise the work so it meets the priorities of the circle (A and B). John senses a tension because he can't fulfill both roles like he wants to. What should he do? Ask both or one lead link to allocate more resources to the role, ask both lead links or one to reallocate the role(s) to someone else?</p>      </div>

<p>The lead link of a super circle can set priorities, but it is still up to role fillers to align to them and decide what and how to integrate that.</p><p>See letter c for duty to align to circle goals: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#413" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#413</a></p><p>If a person is doing their best to align to priorities, then they may want to request a new hire or additional role filler...or if a LL of a sub circle is not getting enough of the person as a resource, they may want to shop internally or externally for more resources...follow the tension. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>It could make sense in my mind for a super circle LL to say prioritize circle A over circle B. In my interpretation, that is fine and it wouldnt have to be a project; it can be a strategy.</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#222" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#222</a></p><p>But again, it may not be enough to get the resources allocated the way a sub circle LL desires.</p><p>In which case, maybe they want an employment level agreement from a highly valuable resource that says Karilen will spend at least 75% of time in "these types of work" and perhaps that could also help.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
