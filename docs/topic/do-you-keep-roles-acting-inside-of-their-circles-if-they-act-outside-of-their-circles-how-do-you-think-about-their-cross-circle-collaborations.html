      <h4>Do you keep roles acting inside of their circles? If they act outside of their circles, how do you think about their cross circle collaborations?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>We have a number of circles and we are finding some challenge in how to think about the interactions of roles across the circles.&nbsp; For example, we have a role in the general company circle called "opportunity explorer" that looks at new product lines, rfps, or service offerings that we should consider.&nbsp; If&nbsp;they&nbsp;find a product that meets our criteria to develop, they need to&nbsp;have a meeting with a rep from our development circle (a&nbsp;sub-circle nested&nbsp;within another gcc sub-circle) as well as&nbsp; with our finance folks in the ops circle (which is also a subcircle of the GCC but parallel to the circle that the Development circle is nested within)&nbsp;to see if the work is viable.&nbsp; How do your teams think about those interactions?&nbsp; Do they happen inside of tactical meetings or outside of them?&nbsp; Do people codify their cross circle interactions with policies and domains.&nbsp; I kind of expect&nbsp;the answer is&nbsp;"it depends".&nbsp; If so, does anybody have some tips for how to think about interactions between roles across circles.&nbsp; I appreciate your brainpower!</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Sam,</p><p>I typically try to avoid cross-linking in early implementations. I have often seen tendencies to link each circle with every other in order to overcome the pain the org experienced in their former structure: lack of information flow, bad sync on interfaces, power games who ultimately rules...etc.</p><p>A few thoughts on how I&nbsp;experience it/coach in practice:&nbsp;</p><p>1) High need for cross-linking might be a good marker for a structure that is not&nbsp;the most requisite regarding&nbsp;the orgs current needs. Rather than "circling" former teams/departments ask which work needs to live close in order to have the most cohesive bundle or work in a circle. So use the "tension" of need of cross-linking&nbsp;to reflect on your setup.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Instead of cross linking you might ask which additional perspective the circle needs to better&nbsp;express its&nbsp;purpose? E.g instead of cross-linking you&nbsp;could create a simple role in your circle that brings in a specific lens (filled by people holding relevant information due to other role-filling in other circles). This is&nbsp;sometimes enough and replaces the initial need for cross-linking.&nbsp;</p><p>3) The most important thing to me in practice - having seen struggles with cross-circle navigation: I frame Gov as a way to continuously create/establish clarity of where acc and authority reside.&nbsp;Once roles are&nbsp;clear (continuously beta)&nbsp;you can "disregard" the structure and use&nbsp;role clarity for highly-efficient role-to-role interaction. No matter which circle they are in. In "mature" practice the aspect of&nbsp;"harming" circle boundaries by walking up to roles directly becomes less relevant IMHO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>May that triggers some thoughts.</p><p>- Gerald</p>      </div>

<p>Thansk Fritz,</p><p>I agree that I don't think that cross-links are the solution.&nbsp; I don't see an issue with the cross circle interactions but just wondered how people think about them.&nbsp; It sounds like your organization and mine view things similarly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does anybody else have differnet approaches?</p>      </div>

<p>This was one thing that worried me when we started with Holacracy. Interaction between the circles and how people work together across circle-boundaries - since I think Holacracy behaves "hostile" for matrix-organizations. What we observed:</p><p>1) we had lots of cross-link-roles. After short times, those roles died quickly wherever the collaborating was not regular and intense.</p><p>2) people started to act outside of circles and meetings and just work together in the background - which worked well. Collaboration is strong in our companies DNA, organization model doesn't affect that this much</p><p>Cross-link-roles don't work well for us. People tend to create new roles inside the circle or they form new circles. And most of between-circle-interaction happens in the background.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>HI Gerald,</p><p>Thanks for your thoughtful response.&nbsp; I appreciate the nuance of it. For your points 1 and 2-this sounds like how we are thinking about things at the moment (even if we haven't articulated it as well as you)&nbsp;.&nbsp; For #3.&nbsp; I think that we were feeling this way but hadn't clearly figured out how to articulate it and also if others might have a different perspective on how that relationship adheres to the rules of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are interpreting things the same way you are (again without having articulated it as clearly).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It fascinating to me how much of this practice is having a general understanding the rules and then getting ongoing affirmation&nbsp;of your team's&nbsp;interpretations of the more subtle/nuanced/complex ways that roles&nbsp; and circle interact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate the community for this function.&nbsp;Thank you!</p>      </div>
