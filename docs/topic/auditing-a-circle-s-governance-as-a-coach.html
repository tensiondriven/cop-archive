  <dd>Auditing a circle's governance, as a coach</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, Some circles in my organization asked for an audit of their circle. In order to do that, I need to go into the detail of each roles, policies, the proposal history, etc. Would it be SO nice to have a way to "export" the whole governance in one clic, into a document so I can easily add some comments (red/yellow lights :-)) and suggestions/options. Anyone doing the same has ever create or imagine it ? H1 ? or anyone ? Through the API maybe ?</dd>
