<p>In Glassfrog there is an 'exclude from meetings' option. Is there any role that has the authority to tick this box by default?</p><p>The Lead Link has this option in Glassfrog, but accourding to the constitution every circle member is invited unless a policy says otherwise.</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Joris,</p><p>The Lead Link may exclude some role holders from the core circle members, regarding their effective contribution of the role to the purpose of the circle (little role with very minor contribution, around 5% of time needed for enacting the role).</p><p>See constitution (de minimis rule):<br /><em>2.3.3 EXCLUSION FOR MINOR ALLOCATIONS</em><br /><em>Sometimes, a Partner allocates only a very minor, nearly insignificant</em><br /><em>amount of attention to a Defined Role in a Circle. If the Circle ’s Lead</em><br /><em>Link reasonably believes this is the case, the Lead Link may exclude that</em><br /><em>Partner from serving as a Core Circle Member as a result of that Role</em><br /><em>assignment.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps,</p>      </div>

<p>What Jean-Michel says is one possibility, there is another one.</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 9"><p><em>2.3.2 EXCLUSION FOR MULTI-FILLED ROLES</em></p><p><em>If multiple Partners are assigned to the same Defined Role in a Circle, the Circle may enact a Policy that limits how many of them are Core Circle Members as a result of that Role assignment. However, the Policy must allow at least one of the Partners filling the Role to represent it as a Core Circle Member, and must specify how that representative will be determined.</em></p><p><em>In addition, any Partners representing the Role have the duty to consider and process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partners, exactly as a</em><br /> <em>Rep Link would were the Role a Sub-Circle, unless the Policy defines an alternate pathway for the excluded Partners to process Tensions related to that Role.</em></p><p>In this case, you need to create a policy in governance and then the Lead Link can “exclude from meetings” all the persons assigned to the role except the representative(s).</p></div>      </div>
