      <h4>Payment Policy</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi,</p><p>I am working now on new "Payment Rules" (who can authorize what kind of spending and up to what amount) - there were some tensions about it.</p><p>As I understand, myself as a Lead Link of GCC, have the right to decide this policy.&nbsp;</p><p>My question is: Do this Rules have to refer to roles, or can it refer to&nbsp;partners?</p><p>I am thinking about some mix, i.e.:</p><p>1, Any role can spend xxx amount when working in role</p><p>2. Any role can spend xxx amount when doing individual action</p><p>3. Additionally: Partners A, B, C can authorize amount up to xxx level, etc....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think about it?</p><p>(from the Constitution point of view, and from your experience)</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Mikolaj,</p><p>You can check the H1 spending policy for inspiration:&nbsp; <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/1499644" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/1499644</a></p><p>If you type spending in the search box you will find more policies within H1 on spending authority.</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Mikolaj,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One quick comment. Overall, I think you're going about it the right one. However, this part, "3. Additionally: Partners A, B, C can authorize amount up to xxx level, etc..." should be changed from "Partners A, B, C" to some sort of "Spending Authorizer" role. So, in addition to the policy, add a part to your proposal to include a simple role to perform the function you intend, then just fill it with the role-fillers you think most appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for comments, I already have some idea how to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>But, there is another doubt:</p><p>1. I am a LL of GCC</p><p>2. We have few sub-circles</p><p>3. I want to create some rule related to payment/cost approval.</p><p>4. There are some roles in a sub-circle, that have special meaning in our cost approval (i.e. raw material purchasing)</p><p>My question is: As a LL of GCC, can I grant some permission to the role that exist in a sub-circle? (from the point of view of constitution, as well as common sense..)</p><p>Warmly,</p><p>Mikolaj</p>      </div>

<p>Mikolaj,</p><p>As GCC Lead Link, you could propose a policy on the GCC Circle that says, "Only Roles X, Y, &amp; Z have permission to..." and Roles X, Y, &amp; Z could exist anywhere including a sub-circle. That would be fine.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since the Roles exist in a sub-circle, you don't have any way of constraining those Roles from&nbsp;evolving (name changes, accountability changes, role-filler changes, etc.), and the GCC policy of course would still give that Role the permission. Now, in practice, I haven't encountered a problem with this since governance changes are transparent, but&nbsp;I thought I'd mention it.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
