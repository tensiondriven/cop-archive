      <h4>Domains in Sub-Circles</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Per 2.1.2, if I am a Role filler in a Circle and the Circle has a Domain, I may "use and impact" the domain.&nbsp; Does that also apply to Roles in any Sub-Circles of the Circle that owns the Domain?</p><p>I tend to imagine that any Roles in a Circle are doing work on behalf of the Circle and therefore have the same level of "access" as the Circle, but as near as I can tell, the Constitution doesn't explicitly specify this.</p><p>As an example, per 5.2, the "'Anchor Circle'... controls all Domains that the Organization itself controls."&nbsp; It seems reasonable that "facilities" falls under "Domains that the Organization itself controls."&nbsp; Clearly (per 2.1.2), if I'm a Role filler in the Anchor Circle, I can "use and impact" facilities.&nbsp; Can a Role filler anywhere in any of the Sub-Circles also "use and impact" facilities without having to write a special policy?&nbsp; My assumption is, yes.</p><p>I think there will be a follow-up question, but I wanted this to be established before asking my other question.</p>    </div>
