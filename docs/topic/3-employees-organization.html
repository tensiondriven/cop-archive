<p>Hi Matheus</p><p>I can talk from direct experience as I'm in a three partner business running Holacracy.</p><p>We adopted Holacracy back in July 2017 - six months ago - after I completed the practitioner training in London.

When confronted with what he was going to do, i.e. take on one or more defined roles, he said "none".

<p>Hi Matheus</p><p>Basically, the hard restriction would be to be at least 2 person (seggregation of Lead Link and Rep Link).</p><p>My two cents: Holacracy works for a 3-ppl-company - but it's not efficient.

<p>My advice is try it out as a way to define the operational structure of the organization before growing the personnel structure. Now is a good time to capture the emerging organizational reality. 3 is a small organization, but clarity is important and will only become more important as the personnel organization grows. You simply must define the operational structure before increasing complexity - which will happen with additional personnel - if the vision and purpose might be compromised with the addition of more people. Having established roles in place also makes it easier to bring new people into the organization since they'll have a meaningful and worthwhile role to fill - to get the ground running in.</p>      </div>

<p>Oi Matheuz !</p><p>I quite agree with Fritz. In my experience, to apply holacracy with only 3 people and feel that the benefits are worth the efforts, you probably need&nbsp; :</p><p>- either people very committed with this new social technology, very convinced</p><p>- or a big "why", a&nbsp;strong concrete issue that the team faces and could be tackle by adopting holacracy</p><p>- or as Fritz describes : a perspective of scaling&nbsp;quite soon, thant you want to prepare.</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe that the 1st option does exist. And personnaly, if I start a business even with just 1 ore two other partners, I want to do it using Holacracy because that the way I want to work.&nbsp;</p><p>About the second part of your question (full x partial application), I would need to understand better what you have in mind to give you my feedback. If you're interested in, please contact me by email (<a href="mailto:v_lagalaye@yahoo.fr">v_lagalaye@yahoo.fr</a>)&nbsp; or PM so we can schedule a conversation.</p><p>Tudo de bom prara você !</p>      </div>

Thanks for the insights!</p><p>I have to say that we have a super similar history, since we started in 4 and decided that the 4th should no longer be a partned for similar reasons!<br /><br />Also, I am the management guy in there, responsible for facilitating the growth of both culture and strategy, as well as the management and communication systems the organization runs.</p><p>So, what I'd like to know is the breaking-constitution process, how flexible can we become when we adopt holacracy and what are the key points that we might not modify in order to keep the framework reliable and getter MORE, not less, engagement?<br /><br />I mean, the defined roles, are all of them necessary in a 3 ppl org? Also, what tips do you have to run it without a lead link within the archor circle? And how important are the defined roles in the archor circle?</p><p>Thanks for the tips and insights!

<p>In a young/small org, it's easy to get caught up in doing everything without capturing and putting into roles everything.

I am wondering if there is a need of a main leader (Lead Link) in the archor circle or if we can just run it 100% horizontal. and if it's needed, how can I position myself as the Lead Link or whatever the name I'm calling this major managament guy?

<p>Hi! Great discussion!</p><p>We have started Holacracy in our organisation one year ago. For beginning we have started as 16 people out of 70. There were, and are, many problems.</p><p>Recently I started thinking that maybe one of the issues is that Full Constitution is just too big, too complex - and it's understanding level is pretty low.</p><p>We try to cover it with trainings, but still, it has some elements that are simply not necessary in our organisation (Cross Links, Rep Links etc.)</p><p>For this reason - undestanding of rules - I started thinking about Holacracy Light model. Does any of you have some document that could be a Light Constitution?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
