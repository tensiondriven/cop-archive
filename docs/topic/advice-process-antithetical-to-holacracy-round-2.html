      <h4>Advice Process Antithetical To Holacracy Round 2</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>So much like my original post about this earlier in the year I am seeking some feedback about new Governance that happened in our anchor circle - which I am no longer a circle member of.&nbsp;I stepped down as Facilitator in large part due to the bad governance still on the books re: inactive circles and the reluctance from others to deal with it and many other aspects of shadow power going on.</p><p>I see so much behavior that Brian warned about in the Coach Training in both extremes - passivity/denial of responsibility to controlling/interfering to socializing/pressuring and circumvention - just so much. I tried to get some understanding across - I have an 18 page report from that training and tried to implement small group and 1on1 sessions, but not much impact.</p><p>All this pushes/pushed my own buttons re: being long taken for granted and an under-resourced part of the infrastructure. I felt that the only way I could get others to wake up to the Holacracy-avoidance would be for me to become tyrannical and declare the (obvious to me) Process Breakdown over and over. I couldn't do that, didn't have the energy to do that, so stepped down.</p><p>I can hear Karilen and Brian in my head reminding that a good Facilitator/Coach keeps that detachment and objectivity - something that I'm very good at when I'm not personally charged - but my work burnout when combined with this shadow power... it has had me more anxious and stressed than even the presidential politics - and that's saying something.</p><p>We also had a reduction in force which has severely impacted my workload and I'm on the verge of collapsing my own circle now that 1/3 of the humans are gone and we've not formally met recently, and I have next year's training calendar and documents and so many projects behind and... &nbsp;&lt;sigh&gt;</p><p>So yesterday, the "Advice Process" which responses to my earlier post confirmed is antithetical to Holacracy, got strengthened/expanded in the anchor circle. This in *DIRECT* opposition to my very strong warning against such during a team holacracy coaching session 2 weeks ago.</p><p>Please read this new governance and provide me with reaction and suggestion.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Policy: Use of Advice Process</strong></p><p><strong><em>When policies or procedural changes materially affect Area operations or the operations of another Circle or Partner, Support Services personnel will use the advice process (<a href="https://mkpconnect.org/info/mk...apted-advice-process" target="_blank">https://mkpconnect.org/info/mk...apted-advice-process</a>) except when it is judged more harm would be done if immediate action was not taken.</em></strong></p><p>Since the referenced process is on a page inside our intranet, I've duplicated it on a viewable&nbsp;Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1He1kAZAVcqkHdqRsHpXs8TdTRR6dLyko0zy6dizjNSo/edit#" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>    </div>
