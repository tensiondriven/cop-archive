      <h4>Change in the Constitution for Lead Link and Rep Link V4.0 / V4.1</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everybody</p><p>When I was trained at PCT we worked with the V4.0 Consitution and lately I noticed some changes in the LL and RL roles between V4.0 and V4.1:</p><ul><li>For LL there is a 6th acc added: "<span style="color: #4f81bd;"><em>Removing constraints within the Circle to the Super-Circle enacting its Purpose and Accountabilities</em></span> ".</li><li>For the RL, the 3rd acc in the V4.0 is: "<em><span style="color: #4f81bd;">Removing constraints within the Super-Circle that limits the Circle's capacity&nbsp; to express its Purpose or Accounabilities</span>".</em> In the V4.1 it becomes <em>"<span style="color: #4f81bd;">Removing constraints within the broader&nbsp; Organization that limit the Sub-Circle</span>".</em></li><li>The Purpose of the RL stays unchanged :"<span style="color: #4f81bd;"><em>...within the Sub-Circle, the Rep Link's Purpose is: Tensions relevant to process in the Super-Circle channeled out and resolved</em></span> "</li></ul><p>My questions :</p><p>Q1 : if I understand well, with V4.0 only RL was accountable for bringing tensions to the Upper-Circle and with V4.1 both LL and RL are accountable for bringing tensions in the Upper-Circle, or am I missing something ?</p><p>Q2 : for the RL, what does the acc "<em>Removing constraints within the broader Organization..</em>." means concretly ? For large organisations, if the authority to remove the constraints belongs to an Upper-Circle which is 4 levels above, how shall the RL do ? Lets take the example of a circle C included in a circle B, B included in A and A included in Z. So to remove a tension from C regarding ressources allocation (authorithy of Z), will he/she engage directly the Z's LL ? Or does he/she will engage A's RL or A's LL, or both ? Or does he/she have to go through B’s RL/LL, who will escalate to A’s RL/LL, who will escalate to Z's LL?</p><p>Thanks for sharing your understanding of that key topics.</p><p>Isabelle</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
