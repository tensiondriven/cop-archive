      <h4>Body language as an out-of-turn comment</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Where do you as a facilitator draw the line between acceptable normal body language and body language used to comment out of turn during the process of a Governance meeting?&nbsp;</p><p>Extreme example would be when a person in the meeting shakes their head repeatedly and sighs when someone makes a proposal they don't like, even when the process is still at the Clarifying Questions stage, or does the same when someone else is commenting in a way they don't like.<br /><br />Some body language is clearly unavoidable, as we are people and not robots, but where does one draw the line between that and an out-of-turn comment? In my experience from both other and Holacracy meetings, strong body language does affect opinions of others.</p><p>I didn't see the Constitution say anything about this.&nbsp;</p>    </div>
