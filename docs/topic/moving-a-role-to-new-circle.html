  <dd>Moving a Role to new Circle</dd>

  <dd>We think that Role "Developer Evangelist" needs to come out from a nested circle in the Engineering Circle and into a nested circle in Marketing circle. With multiple 'cell walls' for the role to move across, which circle's governance meetings should this tension be processed in?</dd>

<p>I'd be interested to know (1) which articles in the constitution support Bernard-Marie's answer and (2) in which way could the super-circle process that tension for example.&nbsp; Thanks !</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey Carrie,</p><p>A few thoughts that come up in addition to Bernard Marie's answer:</p><p>Who is WE in your question? That might give you an indication where to start processing. Might be a tension of a role in one of the nested circles then use the rep link to process it to the super-circle. Practically in the super-circle it is a governance proposal to "restructure sub-circle". And it would probably need separate steps to move it into another nested sub-circle.</p><p>However, I think it is important to be clear and intentional why you are harming circle boundaries in case processing of that tension is started within the super-circle and not triggered by rep links.&nbsp;</p><p>- Gerald</p>      </ul>
