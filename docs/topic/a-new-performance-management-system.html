  <dd>A new performance management system</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I am a university faculty. Yesterday I had a one-day executive education course. One student is from GE. He introduced the new performance management system at GE: PD@GE. The system emphasizes the real-time feedback and flexibility. It seems that the new performance management system fits Holacracy platform.</dd>

<p>I did not have direct experience with the APP used in GE. &nbsp;But the student I mentioned had a positive experience.</p><p>Holacracy is a great system. &nbsp;Because Holacracy is an adaptive system and role structure&nbsp;is evolving, &nbsp;GE's real-time feedback probably works better than traditional performance evaluation approaches. &nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/08/ges-real-time-performance-development" target="_blank">https://hbr.org/2015/08/ges-re...formance-development</a>&nbsp;</p><p>PD@GE is an APP designed by GE. &nbsp;You could check the following to know the user interface.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/28961073/PDGE-Personal-HR-Review-App" target="_blank">https://www.behance.net/galler...rsonal-HR-Review-App</a></p><p>There are&nbsp;other similar performance management systems like Impraise.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.impraise.com/" target="_blank">http://www.impraise.com/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks for sharing. This is great. Is it exclusively GE or is it an app that others (from different companies) can download and use? What is your experience with it?</p>      </ul>
