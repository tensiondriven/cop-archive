      <h4>Governance Process and Collective Intelligence</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello,</p><p>I have a question about the governance process. Is it relevant to consider it as a process of collective intelligence ?<br /><br /> Answer A : no, the main goal is to address a tension. The proposer is aiming to pass his proposal. The reaction cycle helps to purge the egos and avoids many objections.<br /><br /> Answer B : Yes, the goal is to cope with tension by benefiting from the vision of other roles and other people. After hearing the reactions, the proposer will modify its proposal to better respond to its tension.<br /><br /> in my mind, but I'm eager to read your opinions, the answer A has little use of the power of the collective? It is disappointing and relies on the ego of the proposer who aims to realize his proposal.<br /> The answer B requires a humility of the proposer to be aware that he does not see everything and does not have all the good ideas. This answer B seems to me more productive.<br /><br /> (Whatever the answer A or B, I am aware of what is at stake for the facilitator throughout this process of governance, to avoid debates, search for a perfect solution, or attempts to discretely resolve other tensions. )</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kind reminder here bellow :</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.3.5 INTEGRATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS</p><p>&nbsp;(a)</p><p>Present Proposal: First, the Proposer may describe the Tension and present a Proposal to address the Tension.</p><p>(b)</p><p>Clarifying Questions: the other participants may ask clarifying questions to better understand, the Proposer may answer or not.</p><p>(c)</p><p>Reaction Round: each participant may share reactions to the Proposal, one person at a time.</p><p>(d)</p><p>Amend &amp; Clarify: the Proposer may make amendments to the Proposal with the primary intent to better address his Proposer’s Tension, (and not Tensions raised by others).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Jean-Luc,</p><p>That's a very interesting point you bring. I would say yes and no. It's the Proposer's aim to resolve his Tension so (A) and he does not need to be very mindful of his ecology as the system assumes that all other members will be frank and will give objections when they sense the Proposal harm some part of the organisation. In this regards it is in a way a collective intelligence process (B) but quite heavily moderated. Also in the integration round there is space for more emergence and collaboration on finding a good solution.</p><p>I'm just curious from where does your question come from? It it curiosity or is it a result of something else?</p><p>Cheers!</p>      </div>

<p>Hello,</p><p>The focus of the IMD process is to handle Tensions from the Members of the Circle to help the Circle better express it's Governance.</p><p>So yes it is focused on processing Tensions. But it is not aimed on having a Proposal passed. It is focused on having valid Proposals that do not cause harm or set the Organization back. That is where the collective comes in. By allowing the other members to give their reaction on the Proposal the roll filler will harvest additional information that might or might not make him/her decide to change the Proposal. The Objection Round is the part where the collective together checks if the Proposal causes no harm. So this is the space where others can help the Proposer to point out that his/her Proposal as is, is causing harm to the Organization. Finally Integration Round is where the collective comes together to take away the Objections but still with the focus that the Original Tension of the Proposer is still addressed. That is also why the Proposer in Integration needs to confirm that this is the case. Why? Because the process is focused on handling the Tensions from the members one at a time.</p><p>So my answer is NO. But not for the reason of passing or humility but for the reason that the process takes care of the people and provides room for the collective to participate.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;To your question "What would be lacking without Reaction Round?", I would say many things. One is a safe space for people to digest the proposal - some of us need to speak&nbsp;loudly to reflect on something. Another one is a safe space again for people who may feel some pressure, kind like&nbsp;some attachment to the proposal, to express the inner pressure they feel. Another purpose which is my favorite, is to help the Proposer by modeling/offering different pathways that may address the Proposer's Tension. And I'm sure they are more into it.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:532592670943008396]. Fully echo Bernard Marie. Taking out Reaction Round will mean that we do not give the collective the opportunity to express their feelings around the Proposal or provide insights that would help the Proposer to enhance the Proposal.</p>      </div>
