      <h4>No election possible due to objections</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>During the first&nbsp;election for the facilitator of the circle, a holacracy savvy person was&nbsp;proposed for the role.</p><p>One of the circle members then raised an objection stating that it would harm the circle&nbsp;to&nbsp;elect an&nbsp;holacracy&nbsp;savvy person as it would hinder holacracy knowledge to be spread among other people. The ad interim facilitator&nbsp;decided to not test the objection (wich was probably a mistake) and to discard the&nbsp;proposal after the objection round, as he is allowed to do by constitution.</p><p>There were two more possible candidates. Both proposals were objected by the nominated&nbsp;person,&nbsp;as they felt it would cause harm not to elect a holacracy savvy person (basically they didn't feel like accepting the role).</p><p>So all the proposals ended up with objections and the circle was unable to elect a facilitator.</p><p>How is the circle supposed to continue from there?</p>    </div>
