  <dd>No election possible due to objections</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>During the first election for the facilitator of the circle, a holacracy savvy person was proposed for the role. One of the circle members then raised an objection stating that it would harm the circle to elect an holacracy savvy person as it would hinder holacracy knowledge to be spread among other people. The ad interim facilitator decided to not test the objection (wich was probably a mistake) and to discard the proposal after the objection round, as he is allowed to do by constitution.</dd>
