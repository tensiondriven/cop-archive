  <dd>Job Offer language?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Does anyone have language for job offers that they might share? We will have discussed holacracy, but in a job offer we'd like to be very specific that governance binds while we have holacracy, and I'd love to see any examples people have.</dd>

<p>Hi Brian, I know some of our clients have done that and have also adapted the way they present their company - I'll try to get what you ask for even if those are languaged in french.</p>      </ul>
