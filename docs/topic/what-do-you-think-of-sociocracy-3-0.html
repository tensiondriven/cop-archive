  <dd>What do you think of Sociocracy 3.0?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I was just working on writing a guidebook for teams exploring self-management (working title: Deconstructing Holacracy: Approaching Holacracy without the steep learning curve ). In the course of researching some of the history of Holacracy and peripheral concepts, I ran across Sociocracy 3.0 . I'm intrigued by some of their resources . Does anyone have any experience with this form of self-management?</dd>
