  <dd>Hi! I was wondering: A) How do you identify which characteristics are more favourable for a new employee to adapt himself better to a holocratical environment? (How) do you assess this traits in your hiring process? B) Which organizational conditions do you consider specially relevant to enable workers to give their best within self-organizing teams? I will be really thankful for any advice! Holocratical Regards, Eliana</dd>
