  <dd>Mistake on Governance Card?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I don't know if it's my interpretation, but seems like there is a mistake that might confuses people while reading the new governance card. http://www.holacracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Holacracy_Governance-Card_2016-1.pdf On testing objection workflow, on : "Is it not safe enough to try, because significant harm could happen before we can adapt?"" If you say yes, the flow makes the proposal invalid. Shouldn't be otherwise? So, the graphics are just misplaced, right? Cheers,</dd>

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>My first thought was that you were wrong, but&nbsp;looking at the card, I think you are correct.</p><p>"<em>Is it enough safe to try?</em>" if you say <strong><em>No&nbsp;</em></strong>(it´s not safe to try), then it would be a valid objection, but the card says otherwise.</p><p>I agree with you. Let´s wait for other comments.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Bastos,</p><p>Main idea of the testing questions is to check if an objection is valid according to the Holacracy constitution, not to discard the proposal.</p><p>If the objection is valid, the next step of the IDM process is integration: amending the proposal until it both addresses the proposer's tension and erases the objector’s objection.</p><p>About your topic, note that the complete question, <em>if you know previously that the objection is anticipated</em>, is: «&nbsp;Is there a reason we can’t adapt once we get more data <em><strong>OR</strong></em> Is it safe enough to try, knowing we can revisit that any time&nbsp;»</p><p>If the objector answers "Yes, it not safe enough to try, because we can't adapt once we get more data" and can give a grounded example of how the proposal could harm the circle, the objection is valid (at least regarding the known data criteria). That means that both objector and proposer will have to amend the initial proposal until it becomes "safe enough to try", even without known data.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br /> Jean-Michel</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi,</p><p>The card you linked is a new one (Black and Yellow). From my perspective, there is a misplacement as you noticed.</p><p>FYI, there is an hold one (Blue and Green) that I'd in mind which was OK.</p><p>Best,</p>      </ul>

My intention is to make the card easier to understand. The way it is right now, gives the idea that if&nbsp;there is a reason we can’t adapt once we get more data, then the objection is not valid. Please check the card if I'm misunderstanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
