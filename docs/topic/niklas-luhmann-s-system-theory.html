  <dd>Niklas Luhmann´s System Theory</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Does somebody know Luhmann´s System Theory? Some parts of Holacracy remember me on Luhmann´s concept of society. He is also talking about systems, their subsystems and communicating systems. For me it´s a real interesting theory; sometimes not easy to understand - I would not suggest to read Luhmanns books, better to read explanations from other scientists ;-) There are some introductions on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA1ZFflL0Eo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY7638w6gkI Nice...</dd>

<p>Elena, I am familiar with Luhmann and also don't recommend that people read him ha, -- not easy reading! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> However it does speak to the self replicating nature of systems, and it sheds light on the difficulty we have when changing our relational or social dynamics / systems. Holacracy creates a natural disruption to all of these dynamics, so some support in this area is needed. Not all are interested in changing relationships, dynamics, or working through it though.</p>      </ul>
