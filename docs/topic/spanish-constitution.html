  <dd>Spanish Constitution</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi everyone, I am happy to share the Spanish version of the constitution for whoever may be interest. It is not perfect (I translated it myself and I am not a professional translator) but I think is pretty decent, we have been using it and is working but we also have the English version for backup. The idea is that until we have an official version we can improve together with all the other Spanish speaking members in this community. Hope it will be useful, SebastiÁn ...</dd>

<p>This rocks Seba - Great job! I've been through it once very quickly and tidied up a couple of tiny errors. You can review the document revision history to see them. We might discover other things that need corrected over time but I'm very happy to start using it straight away as is.</p><p>Thanks for making this resource available for the rest of us. It's much appreciated!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey Sebastian! &nbsp;I am working with a company with a large presense in LatAm&nbsp;and they would LOVE a Spanish translated constitution, and I'm sure they'd be happy to develop more Spanish materials for Holacracy. &nbsp;I just requested access to the Google Doc, and if you are interested in getting connected with my clients (Findasense) hit me up <a href="mailto:alexis@thoughtfulorg.com">alexis@thoughtfulorg.com</a> &nbsp;Thank you!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Sebastian, it is indeed a monk's work to translate the whole text so I admire your effort and&nbsp;really&nbsp;hope I can get access to this Spanish version. If one day I can make it up to you, don't hesitate to contact me <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> Best wishes, Bert</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Sebastian. Thank you so much for all your translation work.&nbsp;</p><p>We created a repository on GitHub for the Holacracy Constitution in Spanish, for coordinating the translation with more people. Are you interested in participating? If yes and are familiar with GitHub (or are tech savvy enough to figure it out <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> ), PM me your GitHub username.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:449411339497350002],</p><p>at which stage are you with the translation of the Constitution into Spanish?

<p>[@mention:548355922639373031]&nbsp;It's a good question!

<p>[@mention:449411339497350002]&nbsp;in Github it says you created the branch. Who is coordinating this now? Is it you&nbsp;[@mention:551171168851329852]?&nbsp;<br />Id need to know what Spanish language version is intended. If it is Spanisch from Spain (Castellano), then there are quite a few changes to be made to improve this document. I'd love to contribute!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:548355922639373031]&nbsp;! I am from Paraguay, so the translation is in a neutral Latinamerican Spanish. I do not know how much will it vary from Spanish (from spain), It is a matter of reading It, and seeing if &nbsp;it would be neccesary to have different ones. I have not been following up on this, but last time I check (maybe 6 months ago) Not many changes have been made since I&nbsp;translated it. I know it needs a little bit more work.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:456167666651727716],</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply. Yeah its super cool that you provided this version! Thumbs up!&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_thumbsup.gif" title="thumb" /></p><p><br />In general, there are some expressions and wordings in Latin American Spanish that don't feel natural at all to people from Spain. Thus, in general it would&nbsp;make sense to make a Castellano/ Spanish (Spain) version.<br /><br /></p><p>I'll look into it and let you know <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /><br /><br />Saludos</p>      </ul>
