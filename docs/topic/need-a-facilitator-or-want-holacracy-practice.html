<p>Wow, if there are people interested in facilitation practice and we have experience practitioners or have Holacracy coaches, why don't we schedule a community practice group and for us to take turns facilitating governance and tactical meetings. Basically, its taking Brian's Holacracy business simulation during the Holacracy practitioner training and doing that online. Would anyone be interested in that? Would anyone have ideas of how to make that a reality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Purely Poultry need and would love your help with facilitation and/or coaching. Our purposes is "Sharing the beauty of Poultry." You are free to attend my organization Purely Poultry at our tactical and or governance meetings or meet for tea or coffee or an ice cold beer <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> . We are currently a 5 partner organization running on Holacracy for over a year. We have not yet engaged any professional coaches or Holacracy certification training yet. Over the last 6 weeks we went from 2 circles to 7 circles so we are just starting to understand the relationship between super circles and sub-circles works. We would enjoy having a Holacracy practitioner, facilitator, or coach looking for practice come join us for some meetings or to take a peak at some of our governance and have a conversation about how to improve our Holacracy practice.</p><p>Our meetings are via google hangouts Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays usually start no earlier than 10 am and end no later than 1 pm. These times are Central time (Chicago) GMT -6:00. If you read this and those times don't work for you but are still interested I think we can work something out, but we would have to ask the circle Secretary to reschedule the meeting. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Let me know what times and days would work for you via private message if you are interested.</p>      </ul>

<p>As I read through the comments on this topic, I think that would really help in connecting the parties would be the answers to the next questions.</p><p>1. Are you interested in only in person engagements OR Are virtual meetings via google hangouts or skype an option?</p><p>2. Are there windows of days and times that work for you? What time zone are those times in?</p><p>I think it would be very helpful to all future readers of this topic&nbsp;[@mention:476716727638518044]&nbsp;if you could edit your original post to include the above questions.</p>      </ul>

<p>Likewise College is officially Holacratic as of November 1, 2016. We "sandboxed" for just over a year with a group of incarcerated students and another group of local university student volunteers. After taking our emerging distance faculty through a 6 week training course that centered on holacracy, I ceded presidential authority to the constitution. Likewise needs additional experience and exposure that this thread appears to offer. I really like the idea of a Google Hangout that brings lead links from our organizations’ anchor circles into a forum for advanced experience and support. The experience of running through a tactical that brings greater transparency to our community (and that helps us hone in on details like setting metrics, considering resources and priorities, etc) could prove beneficial as we work to grow holacratic practice and the benefits of self-governance in the world.</p>      </ul>
