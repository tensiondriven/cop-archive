Participants range from Practitioner Level to Coach Level and are all there for the learning and opportunity to practice Tactical meeting.</p><p>First session will be on Wednesday 28th of March CET 19.30 - 20.45.

<p>I'd love to join a practice group, but I'm not sure if I'm ready. I've just learned about Holacracy in the last two weeks and still haven't finished reading the book. I have no training or experience yet. Let me know if you think I should wait for the next one.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:580449087370309526], group has started and is full. As this is the first time we set up a group for Tactical we are still experimenting. Guess it will be beter for you to wait a little and join later.</p><p>For practice it is good to have at least some basic knowledge on how the meetings are structure but it is not an obligation. It is the role of the Facilitator to help you through the process.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p><p>I´ve seen that the group is full but if there is any opportunity in the near future I would be very happy to attend to these on-line tactical meetings (even as listener). I have been doing a lot of theorectically self studing (using the book and also Glass frog), but woul be great to have a practical experience.</p><p>Warm&nbsp;Regards</p>      </div>
