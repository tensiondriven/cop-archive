  <dd>Can Lead-links unassign individuals from roles?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>This one is somewhat of a pedantic observation. Based on the constitution's appendix A - the lead link has domain over "Role assignments within the Circle" and is accountable for "Assigning Partners to the Circle’s Roles; monitoring the fit; offering feedback to enhance fit; and re-assigning Roles to other Partners when useful for enhancing fit". But when reading the constitution's section 2.4 "Role assignments", I read that "The Lead Link of a Circle may assign people to fill Defined Roles...</dd>

<p>If it is indeed the intension that the LL can unassign roles (I sort of hoped it wasn't), I think this should also be included in the introduction of section 2.4. Or do either of you think there is a more appropriate place or am I not seeing a detail here? (English is not my native language - so I might very well be misunderstanding the formulations).</p><p>Karilen, I will try to draft a proposal and present it as a pull-request on GitHub, and post the link here. Thanks for that suggestion <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>BTW. Brian as Constitution Steward might want to publish a change to the policy on how proposals for changes to the constitution are considered - if GitHub pull-requests are the preferred way going forward - Just a thought <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

<p>I've added a pull request to the constitution - please add your reactions here or there <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> preferably there ...&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/pull/94" target="_blank">https://github.com/holacracyon...Constitution/pull/94</a></p>      </ul>

<p>Makes sense to me! Currently, the "re-assigning Roles to other Partners when useful for enhancing fit" can be interpreted as, I can take you out of the Role and put someone else in if it is better for the Circle. However, I don't see any harm with clarifying that a little by being "assigning Roles, monitoring fit, providing feedback, and unassigning Roles".</p>      </ul>

<p>Since a domain is property, and therefore up to the role to control, then LL can decide when, if, and how to handle role assignments is my take. Please visit git hub to make suggestions to clarify wording - nice to be in touch Kraen!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution" target="_blank">https://github.com/holacracyon...lacracy-Constitution</a></p>      </ul>

<p><a href="/member/462501715237924468">KRÆN</a>&nbsp;Few other thoughts in case they spark anything useful for anyone: Lead Link authorities can be delegated (such as to a distinct&nbsp;role for handling a particular function handled by LL by default) or constrained - such as a policy, requiring a conversation for example before removing from roles.</p><p>Also, in a mature Holacracy practice (less at the very beginning for some people), an individual has many roles, so removing from a role is not a huge authority in a way.</p><p>Wondering if those options balance out your concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I haven't gotten into the pull requests myself, so congrats on trying that out! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> Practicing and talking is much more my interest, and leaving the language updates or constitutional suggestions to others.</p>      </ul>
