      <h4>Testing Proposal</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p><span>I would like ask some help to have a clear understanding of validating proposals. I copied here the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">section 3.2.3 Testing Proposal of the&nbsp;</span>Constitution 4.1.

However, when assessing the validity of a Proposal,</span> the Facilitator may only judge whether the Proposer presented the required example and explanations, and whether they were presented with logical reasoning and are thus reasonable.</p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Is my undertanding right that this is the validation of the Proposal, but it does not validate the Tension? That the Tension can not be validated?</span></p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the case when the reasoning is illogical? How should I prove with a data supported objection that logic is necessary and the lack of logic is harmful?

<p>Hi ogergo, some quick answer. Would love to go deeper but I have not much available energy for this right now.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>"The Facilitator may test the validity of a Proposal by asking questions of the Proposer."</strong></p><p><strong>In wich steps may the Facilitator do it? &nbsp;I suppose the Objection round and the integration round...&nbsp;Any CCM may request the F to ask it?</strong></p><p>Personally I use the "Clarifying Questions" step to ask several questions like:</p><p>• what's the tension behind the proposal?</p><p>• could you present an actual, specific, and reasonable example situation?</p><p>• the tension comes from/limits which one of your roles?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Any CCM may request the F to ask it?</strong></p><p>Not specified, in the constitution. As a CCM I would ask myself the same 3 questions as before during the Clarifying Questions, state this is not a valid proposal in my reaction if I think so, object as Non Valid Governance, and show up in the integration step if needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Bernard Marie</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>      </div>

<p>ogergo -</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm eager to see responses - it seems that HolacracyOne is engaging much less in the updated Community of &nbsp;Practice, but I've followed your post to be notified of other responses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the Practitioner Training we never tested Proposals, only Objections, so I have no true experience but have been in governance meeting where I thought that proposals might not be valid.</p>      </div>

<p>There was also a longer conversation around this topic on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/issues/29" target="_blank">https://github.com/holacracyon...nstitution/issues/29</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our practise, "Clarifying Questions" seems to be the right place to ask the questions that Bernard Marie pointed out. If there is any doubt about the "logic" of an argument, the proposal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always proceeds</span>, and then perspectives on logic and illogic are integrated in Integration. &nbsp;<img alt="" class="noBorder" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_rudolph.gif" width="15" /></p>      </div>
