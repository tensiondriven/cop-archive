      <h4>Innovation practices in Holacracy organizations</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello everybody,</p><p>I am currently working on my third book, which I'd like to focus on innovation culture and practices of self-organized organizations. I felt very inspired after&nbsp;reading "Holacracy" and "Reinventing Organizations". I am working as an innovation consultant and coach and all of our clients are traditionally structured organizations. As inspired as I was after reading the two books, I was also left with many questions related to my main area of work. How do innovation practices and processes work in detail in organizations running or Holacracy or similar models? I assume there are considerable differences as most innovation systems rely on hierarchy for decision making.</p><p>I'd be very interested to enter a conversation and interview members of Holacracy based organizations about their experiences.</p><p>I am grateful for any hints whom to speak to and direct contacts from people in this community.</p><p>Best</p><p>Florian</p>    </div>
