  <dd>Where to make a policy!</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We have an IT role in GCC, and now we need to make policies around IT. Since it's a role and not a circle, does the role make the policy around an issue like sharing of data with ex members. What if another role has a tension from that policy, where can they bring it up, would they get it in in the general circle of the organisation where the IT circle also participates? Any suggestions.</dd>
