      <h4>Holacracy - capitalist or there is more sharing of wealth with some kind of fair share</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>since&nbsp; holacracy constitution does not talk of compensation and its going to be designed by the partners does it also make it essentially more egalitarian set up. Can holacracy co-exist with a company where some people can concentrate wealth while some are dissatisfied about the compensation system. do all have agency in designing the compensation policies in holacracy, even as they are moving towards the vision mission aim. has any one here wondered on this question and found more connected ways to design the compensation system. please share.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>I think you can find some compensation systems in the holacracy app store, as it sure is a question that's regularly raised (with good reasons).</p><p>Now, are you asking about compensation (ie. salaries) or property (ie. shares)?</p><p>On my end, I don't see a strict correlation between property and work in the organization. I could totally envision a company running Holacracy without everyone being a partner (ie. owning shares, concentrating wealth). That's also the beauty of Holacracy, is that you can use it to setup a dictatorship as well as a totally egalitarian "society", as long as anyone agrees on the rules (and knowing all that can change at the next governance meeting :-) ). For shares, I found the Slicing Pie system (<a href="http://slicingpie.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://slicingpie.com/" target="_blank">http://slicingpie.com/</a></a>) to be kind if neat.</p>      </div>

<p>"Can holacracy co-exist with a company where some people can concentrate wealth while some are dissatisfied about the compensation system"&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is yes, Holacracy in its basic tenets is purposely agnostic with respect to these implementation details, however being dissatisfied about the compensation system is something that might be processed inside holacracy in order to modify the existing compensation system, which brings me to your second question:</p><p>"do all have agency in designing the compensation policies in holacracy, even as they are moving towards the vision mission aim"</p><p>well in some sense yes, and in several ways, the most basic one would be to capture&nbsp;part or whole of the existing mechanism in order to have a starting point and then modify it via holacracy decision processes (capturing reality always&nbsp;generates valid proposals as per the Constitution: see article&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art322" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">3.2.2</a> "a Proposal is always valid regardless of the preceding criteria if it is made solely to help evolve the Circle’s Governance to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening"), if there is not compensation system, than proposing roles and policies to create one becomes the starting point.</p><p>The only "holacratic" way to build a compensation system is to try and fail until the number of related tensions is progressively reduced all other factors kept equal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
