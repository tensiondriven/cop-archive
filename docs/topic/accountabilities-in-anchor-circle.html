      <h4>Accountabilities in Anchor Circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello everyone! I was trying to add accountabilities to my Anchor Circle (GCC not board) But I could not find a way to do it. I have seen some of the companies that have their Glassfrog accounts open and I found that no Anchor Circle has accountabilities. So I would like to know if there is a way to add accountabilities and I just did not find it or is there a REASON&nbsp;why the Anchor Circle does not have accountabilities???</p><p>Thanks!</p>    </div>

<p>IMO it does make sense to expect something from the whole company, because it also has a purpose as a whole, as well as maybe domains / policies, right? I mean, I understand why it's impractical but if there's a purpose, there is a way to express that. Actually, maybe it could even be useful to define acctb on company level, just like a subcircle or a role in another circle will derive its acct/purp from the one above.</p>      </div>

<p>You can't define accountabilities on the Anchor Circle because it represents the whole company. It doesn't make sense to expect something from the company and put an accountability on the anchor circle. You can simply propose an accountability directly on the role you want to expect something.</p>      </div>

<p>An accountability is not describing what the role does (or the circle). An accountability is an explicit expectation for a role so that other roles can rely on&nbsp;this role to do something. So IMO it doesn't make sense, who would like to expect something from your company? It does make sense if you have a Board to expect something from the GCC and you can put accountabilities on it but if you are in the company, it doesn't make sense to expect something on the company, you can directly select the appropriate role and propose an accountability on it.</p><p>The common mistake is to think as an accountability as a way to define all the work done by the role which is not a good use of it. Accountabilities only come when there is a tension and one or more roles need to expect something from another role(s).</p>      </div>

<p>I think a lot of non board entities outside of our company expect stuff from us, and I think it's an interesting thought to capture them in acctb, even sharing them with the outside world. Especially because often people expect things from us as a company, that we don't consider ourselves (and sometimes even them, in case of customers or partners) accountably for. I.e. let's explicitize the world!</p><p>I'm not sure why you address the common mistake of adding all the work as acctb? (it didn't seem a topic to me so far <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />)</p>      </div>

<p>It was just&nbsp;a way of expressing it, I am not saying you don't understand what an accountability is <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I think it makes sense for&nbsp;an eco-system just like we have between us providers and H1 and in this case the accountabilities are defined on the Cross Link role.</p>      </div>
