  <dd>Accountabilities in Anchor Circle</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello everyone! I was trying to add accountabilities to my Anchor Circle (GCC not board) But I could not find a way to do it. I have seen some of the companies that have their Glassfrog accounts open and I found that no Anchor Circle has accountabilities. So I would like to know if there is a way to add accountabilities and I just did not find it or is there a REASON&nbsp;why the Anchor Circle does not have accountabilities??? Thanks!</dd>
