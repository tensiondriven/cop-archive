      <h4>What if no one wants to take a role.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>If there are roles, that the General Circle has created in governance and as a lead link i dont find any one willing to take it up. We also tried to break them into smaller roles, but still no one wants to take more so because one person feel that the other person is not contributing enough.&nbsp;</p><p>What are my pathways as a lead link to deal with it.&nbsp;</p><p>1. To ask the person who is being accused, that they are not contributing enough, to tell their priorities and how their time is being spent. To have a chat with them to understand how they are giving the time that has been agreed as per their engagement contract.&nbsp;</p><p>2. To break the roles further, in governance so its not too many accountabilities in it and can be shared by others.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Bring it as a governance tension that some roles are not being filled and more inputs are needed to develop a policy or a role to deal with it. Maybe if people are not putting in the energy then its not a priority for the organisation. The role is about cooking and house keeping. I can also bring in a proposal that we dont need cooking by the organisation and each person can make their own meal. As a lead link who now has that role, i can make policies for how the task will be organised.&nbsp;</p><p>Would like to hear inputs on how others have managed to work with such issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Shammi&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Sure&nbsp;[@mention:592697186098486484], u can share here when u need support. I am learning to begin to break into smaller roles and asking people why they don’t want to take the role, understand their tension and then respond to the tension. Besides, some people may have barrier of knowledge and skill needed for that role as they don’t have it. Many factors come in the play.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
