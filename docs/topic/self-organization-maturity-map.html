<p>This is very helpful for companies moving towards self-management. There are in fact several aspects that need work and a table summarizing them is great.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, for every aspect, it exposes the possible little steps to enhance the practices of each of them, smoothly and constantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great table! Good reference sheet. Thanks!</p>      </ul>

I love this. My only complaint is that it is a tiny font size. Way too much for an 8.5x11. Maybe it could be 2 pages landscape. The content is really rich.      </ul>

Very useful tool that could be the basis for some sort of "measurement system" to implement and monitor in the adoption of Holacracy. &nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>I printed it out on 4 sheets of paper and taped them together to make it poster sized. Worked out pretty well. Was interesting to see where we are in the various categories</p>      </ul>

<p>Super invigorated by this since I saw it at the PCT in August! It made it up onto the 'wall of inspiration'. <img alt="" class="noBorder" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Self-Organization Maturity Map" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz3B4m_QWMU4Sm9ZRHd4TDZOOVNrS21IZUpZTkVrbzZaTWRJ/view?usp=sharing" title="Self-Organization Maturity Map" /></p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks for this most helpful tool for seeing how companies and practionners move forward their Holacracy path. It's fine to see how this kind of tools are evolving from one training to another.</p>      </ul>
