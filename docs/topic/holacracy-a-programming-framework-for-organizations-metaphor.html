  <dd>Hi guys, I just quickly wanted to share an insight that has given me a lot of clarity of the use and limits of the Holacracy constitution and why it is so important that everyone in the organizations learns about these rules. It basically served me as the best answer to statements like: "We don't have time to learn Holacracy right now" or "We already know the basics, why spend more time?". Holacracy is a framework that sets out the basic rules on which a self-managed company can run on.</dd>
