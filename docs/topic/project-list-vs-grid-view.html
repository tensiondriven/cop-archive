  <dd>Project List vs Grid view</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello Practitioners, Jonathan as UX Designer/Glassfrog here. I have a question for you about the My Projects view, and specifically the Project List view vs Project Grid view. We'd like to unify the Project views, and are thinking about using the Grid View on the My Projects page. My questions are: - Do you or your clients use the project list view (My Projects)? Do you like it? - Do you or your clients use the project grid view (on Circle pages)? Do you like it? How could it be improved? -...</dd>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p><p>Here are my answers:</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project list view (My Projects)? Do you like it?</em></p><p>I don't use it but I know my clients do, when they add their projects. Personally, I have a good trusted system so I update my projects on GF before a tactical meeting, on the circle's page. But, our clients that are new to Holacracy like to have the My Project tab to be able to have all their projects and update them all in one place - they use it as a trusted system and I thing it is a pretty good thing because having a trusted system takes time and is a higher bar to reach. GF should have the minimum for a trusted system and it includes this tab IMO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project grid view (on Circle pages)? Do you like it? How could it be improved?</em></p><p>Of course we use it, when facilitating tactical meetings! We usually set it up&nbsp;with the project grid&nbsp;view (not row view) (and per roles), only because we can see the status more clearly and it helps the learning when we facilitate&nbsp;our clients.</p><p>I think it is pretty good. The only “bad” thing it that it is not synchronous. If the Secretary modify a project or its status during the tactical meeting, then you need to refresh the page to be able to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>- If the My Projects tab showed the grid view instead of the list view, would that cause harm? &nbsp;(If so, what specific problems do you think might arise?)</em></p><p>I think that a list is easier to read when you have all your projects so I would let it like this personally but, again, I don't use it so I should ask my clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I like the fact that GF is dealing with two notions: individual and&nbsp;org/circle. I think you have a lot more to do for the individual (like a My Actions tab) but you should also keep the org/circle views because we need it for meetings and Holacracy explanations, etc..&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is my contribution on this topic "Projects views".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project list view (My Projects)? Do you like it?</em></p><p>Yes I do and I like it, especially for the "Created" sorting tab, which allows me to track what ongoing project has been lasting for&nbsp;too long and deserves to be either revised or split (too big, not realistic and discouraging) or merely&nbsp;energized a bit more, if left aside&nbsp;for too long.&nbsp;I believe dates can be added easily on the grid view anyway...</p><p>Another though is if a LL could access this type of list view for the entire circle, I believe the dates&nbsp;could give a good tool to monitor roles and how they fit the people, and/or if the governance structure is not at its best (role splitting when projects last too long...).</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project grid view (on Circle pages)? Do you like it? How could it be improved?</em></p><p>Yes, I do use it too, when facilitating meetings of course, but also as&nbsp;it gives me a very visual view of all projects, which I love (I'm very visual) by separating them well.</p><p>Although I'd love to be able to slide and drop projects sometimes to re-organize them in regards to changing priorities for the circle, which I can only do with my personal trusted system so far (using OmniFocus).</p><p><em>- If the My Projects tab showed the grid view instead of the list view, would that cause harm? &nbsp;(If so, what specific problems do you think might arise?)</em></p><p>As I said before, I would regret the "Created" tab showing dates, but I could easily adapt to any other view anyway. Also, what do you think of the LL monitoring tool it could become, if "Created"&nbsp;tab&nbsp;and the list view were extended to an entire circle's roles's list ?</p><p>Finally, ss Margaux said, a "My Actions" tab would be a super friendly tab for most people I met, at least this is what I heard from them each time I presented GF. Also friendly for people not used to OmniFocus, Asana, etc, and&nbsp;people not familiar (hating?...) computers... Less to learn, all in one place ! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Looking forward&nbsp;to discover the future GF features and changes that will come out of this forum...</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts, Fabien and Margaux! &nbsp;I would love to hear from a couple more practitioners or coaches before prioritizing these features - So if anyone else has thoughts, please share them!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p><p>I like the grid view a lot. and the flexibility the view has.</p><p>And I like your idea to just go to just one view for projects instead of the two different views.</p><p>Adding this up for me it makes sense that the my projects view will look similar as the grid view of the circle projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p><p>I use the grid view most of the time. &nbsp;I have a good trusted system, but still review my projects by circle (grid view) as part of my weekly review to make sure I haven't missed something.</p><p>Thanks for asking!</p><p>- Dennis</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks for your feedback, everyone. &nbsp;My sense is that some people will feel we are moving backwards if we go with a unified project card view, and eliminate the list view. &nbsp;So, as UX Design for Glassfrog, I'm not completely sold on eliminating the list view, though I would really like to simplify our treatment of projects (and get basic personal system support into Glassfrog with the addition of Actions, but that's another story.)</p>      </ul>
