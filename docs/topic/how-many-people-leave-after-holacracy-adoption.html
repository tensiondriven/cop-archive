  <dd>How many people leave after Holacracy adoption?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi! I believe that Holacracy isn't for everyone and isn't for every company. I assume that when adopting Holacracy, there are people that decide to leave. Does anybody have the data on what percentage of people usually decide to leave the company after Holacracy adoption? Also, can anyone from H1 share what percentage of the transitions have been reversed?</dd>
