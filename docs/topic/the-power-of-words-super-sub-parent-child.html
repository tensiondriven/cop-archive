      <h4>The Power of Words : Super / Sub; Parent / Child</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Some reverberations still occurring for me as result of Coach Training in June, and the drive to *crush* shadow power structures/processes/ideologies...</p><p>I heard Brian express some of the human tendencies to use language to subtly reinforce some of these shadow powers, and one example being the 'parent' circle and a 'child' circle to explain what the constitution calls 'super-circle' and 'sub-circle'.&nbsp;</p><p>BUT this has a shadowy vibe regarding importance and elevation of value, of promotion/demotion when roles relocate, that souls in roles may find hard to keep distinct with such hierarchy-laden terms.</p><p>Brian went on to more commonly refer to the 'super-circle' as 'broader circle' which resonates w me, as it has a broader scope in its purpose. I'd adopt that terminology almost exclusively if I could find a tidy antonym to describe the sub-circle that seemed to work.</p><p>"Narrower-circle" is the knee-jerk antonym but doesn't feel useful.</p><p>"Precision" resonates but has no useful '-er' comparative to 'Broad-er' (Precision-er just doesn't work)</p><p>I've also consider:</p><ul><li>Close-r - which&nbsp;<em>sort of</em> works</li><li>More focused - which resonates but is a bit long</li><li>Finer?</li><li>More detailed?</li></ul><p>But am now leaning towards something use in technical speak, and I'm seeking feedback about how it lands.</p><p>GRANULAR.</p><p>Grammatically speaking, it should be 'More granular' - and I believe I will use 'more granular' in some contexts when I am directly comparing it in relation to the 'broader' circle and 'granular' in other contexts when I am referencing it alone.</p><p>Okay wordsmiths - what are your opinions?</p>    </div>
