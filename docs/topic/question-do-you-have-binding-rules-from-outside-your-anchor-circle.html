      <h4>Question: do you have binding rules from outside your anchor circle?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>When we adopted the Holacracy practice we quickly came to to a simple question that we fail to answer upon today: shall we transfer all "binding rules" into regular policies or should there be something "outside" our anchor circle that limits of what we can do or not.</p><p>I'm speaking of certain work regulations (how much vacation people have), binding security rules we have to follow because of laws etc.</p><p>I would like to know if you in your organization have to obey to certain&nbsp;limitations that come from outside your&nbsp;anchor circle thus established holacracy-processes (tensions, integrations) do not work because they basically affect a domain that's not hold by any circle yet limits your actions</p>    </div>

It makes sense to link "outside rules"&nbsp;to&nbsp;Glassfrog and make all those rules visible to get a central overview.</p>      </div>
