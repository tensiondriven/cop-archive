  <dd>Rep-link for a circle consisting of two sub-circles</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We have a circle that includes 2 sub-circles consists which differ in the type of work, purposes and expectations. Each sub-circle consists of 3 people and 5 roles (lead-link, rep-link, secretary, facilitator, programmer). There are no other roles in this circle. (see image http://pastenow.ru/1O3O4) Who can be a candidate for the role of a rep-link for this circle, so that he represents the interests of this circle in the Anchor circle? If we choose a member of one of the sub-circles as a...</dd>

<p>Hi JEAN-MICHEL! Thanks for the answer! But in a Broad circle there are no other roles, except the Lid-link. Whose interests will Rep-Link present in the Anchor Circle? Interests of lead-links of sub-circles?&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859],&nbsp;thanks for the answer!&nbsp;<br /><br />In the current structure these sub-circles are departments. Authorities for hiring employees, assigning metrics and expectations are at the head of the lower level, since the top-level manager can not effectively cope with these duties. If we create one common circle, these functions are returned to the top-level manager (lead-link), which will negatively affect the efficiency. Can the lid-link transfer these powers to any of the roles of the circle?</p>      </ul>

<p>We solved this problem as follows. We have united these 2 departments in one circle and created a separate role, which was partially delegated the authority of the lead-link for hiring and firing employees.</p><p>I'm not sure if such a solution is correct</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:558068091793200931]&nbsp;To add on Jean-Michel's comment, I would be curious to explore with you any possibility for making &nbsp;the structure may be simplier given the small numbers of roles here - why not having two roles instead of two sub-circles within the circle.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Nadir,</p><p>Except the Lead Link, any core member of the Broad Circle may be elected as Rep Link of this Circle to the Anchor Circle.</p><p>He/She will "represent the interests" of the Broad Circle in the Anchor Circle, not the&nbsp;interests of the Sub-Circle 1 and the Sub-Circle 2, which are already represented in the Broad Circle though RL1 and RL2.<br /><br /> Hope that helps.</p>      </ul>
