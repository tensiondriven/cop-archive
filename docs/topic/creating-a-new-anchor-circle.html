      <h4>Creating a new anchor circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>My wife Ruth Danke and I own the company Purely Poultry which is currently a General Company Circle with 8 core partners that has been using Holacracy for 4 months now. My wife and I want to start other businesses as well. We are looking to basically create an Anchor Circle called "Danke Enterprises" or something like that and have the Purely Poultry GCC be a sub-circle of the Danke Enterprises Anchor Circle. Does this need to be passed through the governance of the Purely Poultry circle?</p><p>Are there any other company anchor circles that have only 2 partners in it other than the rep link from a sub-circle? Does that mean then that the Lead Link of the Anchor Circle has to be the Secretary and the other has to be the Facilitator?</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Tyler: Re your first question: The way to do this practically is to&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Rename the existing GCC to "Danke Enterprises"</li><li>Create a new Role for "Purely Poultry" and make that role into a circle, moving the&nbsp;existing Roles into it</li></ol><p>This can/must be done through the Governance Process of the existing circle.</p><p>(Or alternatively you and your wife could revoke the decision to work with Holacracy and set the organisation up anew, if that seems more easy.)</p>      </div>

<p>Re: your second question: I think we (Structure &amp; Process, at that time called Röll &amp; Korvenmaa) had a structure like the one you image: There was an Anchor Circle (called "Board") which had Cross-Links for me and my business partner (and two more roles, for the partnership system and legal). Then there was the Rep-Link from the GCC, where the work took place. And of course, a Facilitator and a Secretary:</p><figure class="image"><img alt="Röll &amp; Korvenmaa Organisational Structure, March 2014" height="519" src="http://structureprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/140306-OrgStructure.jpg" width="800" /> <figcaption>Röll &amp; Korvenmaa Organisational Structure, March 2014<br />(taken from <a href="http://structureprocess.com/blog/holacracy-alltag-praxis/" target="_blank">http://structureprocess.com/bl...cracy-alltag-praxis/</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At this time, our Anchor Circle had no Lead Link. When this changed later, then indeed, the Lead Link&nbsp;became Secretary and the other partner the Facilitator (to avoid having the same person fill Lead Link AND Facilitator, which would be unconstitutional).&nbsp;</p><p>Does this help?</p>      </div>
