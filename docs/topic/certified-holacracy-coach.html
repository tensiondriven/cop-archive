      <h4>Certified Holacracy Coach</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello CoP,</p><p>I'm preparing myself to take the Facilitation Assessment for getting the coach certification. Here is experience with Holacracy so far:</p><ul><li>I've read most of the material available online, Brian's book, CoP, videos, and more;</li><li>I led an implementation at&nbsp;a company that I was working as an Agile Coach without any support from&nbsp;Certified Coaches, except for the CoP;</li><li>So far, I have been facilitating governance and tactical meetings at least twice per month since last year (almost a full year);</li><li>I am running Holacracy in my own company (3 people only);</li></ul><p>I'm pretty comfortable facilitating meetings, explaning the intent and purpose of every step, and detecting the most common pitfalls (like trying to set new expectations inside Tactical meetings).</p><p>Unfortunatelly, I could not attend to any oficial&nbsp;trainings because I can't afford them right now.&nbsp;</p><p>My question is simple: Do you think I should give it a try? What should I be careful about?</p><p>It is also not clear to me if during the assessment I need to play as participant or secretary,&nbsp;or only as facilitator. The page does not provide much information...</p><p>I appreciate any help you can provide.&nbsp;Thanks!</p>    </div>
