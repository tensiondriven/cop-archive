<p>Right Stephan, If V 4.1 then all you need is article 5.3, and it is like "pre-ratification" for a circle...so the Lead Link can do whatever structuring they want until the circle meetings for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art53" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art53</a></p>      </ul>

<p>In that case, then may be a better approach to allow Governance to drive changes if there are roles in the new circle that are currently filled and being operationalized. Just because you can change the structure that way doesn't mean it is the best way. Holding an initial Governance meeting with the existing team could drive more engagement rather than Lead Link structuring. Let us know what happens!</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks Karilen, My take as well just muddied a bit as the circle was formed as a new circle but absorbed existing sub circles.</p>      </ul>
