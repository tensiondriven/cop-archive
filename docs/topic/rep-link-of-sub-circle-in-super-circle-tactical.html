  <dd>Rep Link of Sub-Circle in Super-Circle Tactical</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Had an output to assign to the sub-circle Rep Link in a tactical meeting, but Rep Link wasn't an option in the dropdown of roles. Why is that?</dd>

<p>I agree with Bernard Marie. The reason is perhaps that the Rep Link is not meant to get&nbsp;requests for actions and projects from the broader circle â€” that's the Lead Link's role. The Rep Link represents a&nbsp;sub-circle, but&nbsp;if someone wants to request actions or projects from a sub-circle, they should direct the request to&nbsp;its&nbsp;Lead Link, not its&nbsp;Rep Link.&nbsp;</p><p>That said&nbsp;sometimes as Rep Link you want to take an action or project for yourself, and it would make sense to me too&nbsp;for GlassFrog to allow it. Maybe with a little warning message that the Rep Link isn't supposed to process requests from the broader circle <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </ul>

<p>Yes, you're right. GlassFrog do not allow for this feature. It should in my opinion as any Sub-Circle's Rep Link is a Role within the Circle. When this happens, I will use "individual action" instead of Rep Link of a Sub-Circle.</p>      </ul>

<p>Yup, what Olivier said! There is a story deep in the GlassFrog backlog to allow assigning projects and actions for Rep Links and I'll add an upvote for everyone who posted here.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks Alexia.&nbsp;</p><p>There are cases where we encountered the need during Tactical Meetings to capture Next-Actions for a Sub-Circle's Rep Link asking for it. And in our experience, this not exceptionnel, it may happen from time to time.</p>      </ul>
