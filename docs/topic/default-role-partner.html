      <h4>Default Role: "Partner"</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a question (I am sorry if already discussed, but could not find the answer in forum)</p><p>Is it possible to say, that everyone in organisation has a "default role" of Partner?</p><p>Sometimes when we disucss issues relating to everyone in organisation (salary, holidays, schedule, working days etc.), some&nbsp;Partners have tensions or objections, but it is not clear from which role - they usually say "from all my roles" or "as a partner" is this way of thinking correct?</p><p>I would be very greatfull for any comment.</p><p>Regards</p>    </div>

<p>The entire point of assigning roles is exactly so that people don't bring tensions from this undifferentiated point of view.</p><p>We want them to have to define their tension as coming from a Role and if they can't bring it from the POV of a Role, we want them to understand that that tension is not valid for the current Governance or Tactical meeting.</p><p>For tensions related to human issues like you discussed, I suggest setting up a Role that works with those issues. &nbsp;For example, we have an&nbsp;@EmployeeHappiness role.</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you for the reply, but... <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I understand your point, and I understand the whole idea.</p><p>Still I don't know what should I do as a&nbsp;Facilitator with the&nbsp;situation like that:</p><p>1. Someone&nbsp;have the proposal to make all salaries public - the idea is that the more transparency is better - for many reasons.</p><p>2. Someone have an objection, and when tested he might say - "I feel it in my all roles, because if my salary is public, I don't feel good and I loose motivation for my work..."</p><p>Does it sound like a valid objection?</p>      </div>

<p>Mikolaj: &nbsp;When&nbsp;testing that objection, I'd ask the objector if there's a specific role they can point to, with a specific purpose or specific accountability that's made more difficult, or if they have a general sense that it'll be harder on them as a partner to energize any role? &nbsp;If they say the latter, I'd say they just told me it's not a valid objection. &nbsp;If they say the former, then I'd ask them which role and which purpose/accountability, and how it would be harder to express that one...</p>      </div>

<p>Mikolaj - this is a known issue <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Basically, Holacracy is not intended to cover these kind of Partner issues. It's only designed to regulate roles IE work. At the same time, in self-governing organisations we do come across issues relating to people (like salary) that we somehow need to give everyone a say in. How do we do that? Our solution at GrantTree is to have a Partner role in a separate sub-circle of the Board.</p><p>See this thread for more:&nbsp;<a href="/topic/domains-and-policies?reply=563698739569210687#563698739569210687" target="_blank">...7#563698739569210687</a></p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for comments, I&nbsp;almost understand.... : )</p><p>So in other words, this is a "real problem" of a Partner, but this is not "valid objection" of a Role.</p><p>So there should be some Role to take care of Partner's problems (Like Partners Representative?), and this Role could make a valid objection - is that right?</p><p>Regards</p>      </div>
