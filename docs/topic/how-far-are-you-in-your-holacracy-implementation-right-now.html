  <dd>I am trying to figure out what are proven paths in introducing Holacracy (particularly for a larger company). For this purpose I created the here linked map (=&gt; Holacracy implementation paths ) to be able to express what are the steps... My position is currently B1 My path has been A1-&gt;A2-&gt;A3-&gt;B1 Will you share your path with us? What is your experience? Andrea</dd>
