      <h4>Perceptions of Holacracy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>So, I was reading an interesting new book -&nbsp;<em>New Power - How its changing the 21st century and why you need to know&nbsp;</em> by Henry Timms and Jeremy Heimans - and was taken aback by 5 paragraphs on pp 235-6. Holacracy was the topic, and it is described as 'new power for robots'. 'Restrictions and protocols, with a good sprinkle of jargon, become the focus under Holacracy, not the work itself.' There is also the claim that 1/3 of Zappos staff left in 2015 partly as a result of Holacracy, and that Medium has 'abandoned Holacracy', saying that 'it was getting in the way of the work'.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most puzzling aspect was the claim by Julia Culen that Holacracy took away her 'natural authenticity as well as my feeling of aliveness'. It was from a 2016 post on Medium...</p><p>As I see it, Holacracy doesn't fit their new power model because it violates their idea of spontaneity and agility (which is all new power-based). The book just runs out of steam at the end, or at least one chapter too soon. It claims to tell me why I need to know about new power, which it does, I suppose, but it has nothing to say about what to do about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
