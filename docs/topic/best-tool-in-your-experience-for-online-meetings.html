  <dd>Best tool (in your experience) for online meetings</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I was wondering what is the tool that, in your experience, is proving as the most reliable for conducting online meetings (governance &amp; tactical). I also need the possibility of having from one to a few people to the same place, while others are connecting remotely (always from one to many for each location).</dd>
