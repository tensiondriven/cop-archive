<p>I have heard from Sociocracy that the lead link take the info from top circle to sub circle and rep link brings the issues of the sub circle to higher circle. I had heard since they are two different functions, its better to have two break the role.&nbsp;</p><p>I also see that glass frog does allow the two roles to be taken by same person.&nbsp;</p><p>Any thoughts?&nbsp;</p><p>Shammi&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>No, see article 2.5.1 last sentence</p><h4>2.5.1 Elections &amp; Eligibility</h4><p>The Facilitator of each Circle will facilitate regular elections to elect a Core Circle Member of the Circle into each of its Elected Roles, using the process and rules defined in Article III.</p><p>All Core Circle Members are eligible for election and each may hold multiple Elected Roles, except for the Lead Link of a Circle, who may not be elected as its Facilitator or Rep Link.</p>      </div>

<p>@Shammi In case it helps clarify:&nbsp; It’s perfectly allowed to assign someone who is a circle’s Rep Link to its Lead Link role; it’s just not allowed to elect someone who is Lead Link into the Rep Link role.&nbsp; The prohibition isn’t on the same person filling both roles - there’s nothing wrong with that; the prohibition is on the assignment/election into the role, and only in one of those two cases.</p><p>The Lead Link's purpose is to hold and represent the interest of the parent circle INTO the sub-circle. The Rep Link's purpose is to hold the tensions OUT of the sub-circle into the parent circle. The reason a Lead Link can not be elected as its Rep Link is&nbsp;the two roles can conflict and one person can't reasonably process those tensions if they fill both roles. Basically, it creates a conflict of interest.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:588613650771009734], Thanks for your response. I read your words "It’s perfectly allowed to assign someone who is a circle’s Rep Link to its Lead Link role; it’s just not allowed to elect someone who is Lead Link into the Rep Link role.&nbsp; "</p><p>I also get the spirit of it that it will be a conflict of interest if we have the same person. My question is, now, is it categorically written any where in the constitution, the stuff that I have quoted you on above here?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
