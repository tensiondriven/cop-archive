      <h4>Online Holacracy-powered Entrepreneur School.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Here is an idea. I see the need to create a vehicle that have people online practice Holacracy. Actually, I thought about creating a business role-playing game that people can access online more akin to the tabletop format for those who know about roleplaying . I call it GBA Play or Gamma-Beta-Alpha Play. Like software phases, Gamma play is pure simulation where participants would role-play a Holacracy business to get the mechanics. Beta play would be incorporating the <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-heck-project-based-learning-heather-wolpert-gawron" target="_blank">project based learning model</a>&nbsp;and the group would develop their business circles which would inform their plans of their business holacratically&nbsp;and alpha play is supporting their Holacracy circle with resources and questions. I am actually proposing an new educational method for teens and adults. A kind of a Holacracy-styled business school and for it to occur online. Of course, I have no business experience although i do have some Holacracy experience which means I would be interested with others who would be interested in an idea such as this. I have always felt that a barrier to Holacracy is not enough access to simulated practice as well as having a smoother incorporation of other needed subjects in a real-world way. To turn Holacracy into a learning journey is a way to address that. What does everyone think about that?</p>    </div>
