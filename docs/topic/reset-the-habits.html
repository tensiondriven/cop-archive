      <h4>Reset the Habits</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi, asked more than a week ago (sent 3 emails) to re-set to 0 the Habit program as the habit program was started normally in French, but we received it in English, making the people of the company delete them [the mails], and therefore not reading naturally. Would like to know when is it possible to do this, as so the company still receive habits but those are kind of useless as the first two weeks were in English... Therefore making them miss the first 2 weeks. In addition, would it be possible to be able to re-set that on our side rather than having to pass on the GlassFrog support? As it's rather long. Thanks in advance!</p>    </div>
