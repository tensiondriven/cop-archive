  <dd>exclusion for minor allocation of a sub circle</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, In the constitution, about the 2.3.3 Exclusion for minor allocations chapter : could we apply this for a sub-circle ? In other words, can a LL exclude the LL of a sub-circle from serving as core circle member ? My interpretation of the constitution would be yes, but just to be sure.</dd>

<p>Interesting.. Sounds a bit strange from my experience but from my interpretation of the Constitution, it would be possible.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be interested to know more about the specific case, as a Lead Link Role is a key one and as a LL of a Super-Circle I would need to see all Sub-Circles LL processing tensions and not having to process them as I would have a duty to consider and process Tensions conveyed by the excluded Partner.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hello Xavier,</p><p>Sounds valid governance, but strange situation!</p><p>In the uper-circle, LL is just a role. If the role is excluded for minor allocation, that means that the role has a minimal contribution to the uper-circle, so that there is a low coupling between the sub-circle and the uper-circle... Wich is a clue that the 2 circles should be clearly separated actually.</p><p>Does that make sense? Regards.</p>      </ul>

The question thats surfaces to me, is whether those roles in such circle are part of the membrane of GCC (Purpose, Domains, Accountabilities) or is that a bunch of activities that were simply attached to a hierarchical manager as often the case in large companies running the conventional way. I assume it's the latter... and now I think get your original question.</p><p>You could create a Super-Circle including the actual GCC + such Circle at the same level - because reality sounds like there are two different sub-holarchies here.... related to the same ex-manager</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. To give you more insight of that situation : The upper circle is the GCC.</p><p>1.

But as they are initially in the GCC,&nbsp;I don't see right away how I should/could propose this, and where should I "send" those !</p>      </ul>
