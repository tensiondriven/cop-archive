  <dd>Attention Points as budget tool</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, I was wandering if the Attention Point Policy could be used as a budget tool. Is there someone who's already using the Attention Points App, and what about budget ?</dd>

<p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>I have implemented Attention Points at one of our clients.</p><p>One of the things it creates is an internal "Supply &amp; Demand" of attention (or in simple words time). For which the Points are its currency to exchange attention.</p><p>I could definitely see a similar way to do budgets. You allocate "Budget points" (you might just call them Euro's) circles and roles. Which is for them just like attention points a resource to spend within the role.</p><p>Its definitely one way to do budgetting. It is kind of a cheque for each circle/ role to spend on what they find important for their role up to their max "Budget points".</p><p>You could then define some auxiliary processes/policies that add a bit of alignment between points spenders if you need for larger amounts of descretionary spending.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Koen</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Koen, this is indeed the path I intend to try.</p><p>That won't be euros but FTE , 1 FTE being&nbsp;100 AP. But same idea.</p><p>My issue would be using GF to do that, and not having to build another system in parallel to handle this. So I need to store AP on a circle level, and on assignment level (for instance : Role X Partner A = 20 AP).</p><p>For circle, I could add a custom section, so that's fine. Any idea for assignment ? For me, the only thing available would be the focus, not the right place I think :-(</p>      </ul>

<p>hi&nbsp;[@mention:491495232183315418]&nbsp;- agree. the simplest form for APs (FTE or budget) I have done is through publishing a note on the role page of the Lead Link (or whichever role in each circle is the appropriate holder of this information).</p><p>Advantages: You can start it in a couple of minutes. Updates are send around the circle automatically. And each Lead Link has some good autonomy to do it in a way she/he likes.</p><p>The primary drawback is that the note doesn't automatically calculate the sum of the points so it is a bit of a manual process especially across circles. And it requires deliberate attention (a habit) of each circle to make it work (that might also be a good thing to not automate this too much).</p><p>This&nbsp;might especially be harder to manage for larger organizations, but that at least is a good tension to then introduce a separate system. An intermediate step could be a google sheet or excel which you link to for each circle to solve the "difficulty of calculation totals and differences" tension.</p><p>I had a client that created a dedicated web-app for attention points that integrated with Glassfrog through the API. They will present it at the forum in May.</p><p>Koen</p>      </ul>
