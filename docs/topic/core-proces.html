  <dd>Core proces</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>We are a training/consulting firm. Beside specific roles, almost all of us have the role of trainer/consultant. How do you fit this in a role? As nobody is rep link but we all are responsible to do this core proces of our firm. Does anybody have a good role description for us? Thnx!</dd>

<p>You might consider not having <em>one</em> role for this, but to have separate roles for the different <em>projects</em> your trainers/consultants are working in!</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Yves, I once applied holacracy in my own&nbsp;consulting team. And we experimented with a client circle as well as a project circle as well as a team circle. With lots of +/- on each of them in our experience. we found that the complexity and intensity of the project work we did as a consults hugely benefited from diversification of a single consulting role.</p><p>happy to talk you through it. just send me a DM and we connect.</p><p>Koen</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Yves,</p><p>You can have multi-filled roles as allowed by the constitution (2.4.2 Assigning Roles to Multiple People)</p><p>An example to illustrate is the&nbsp;role "Facilitator Coach" filled by 7 people in HolacracyOne as we can see it in their public holarchy : <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/circles/8670" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/circles/8670</a></p><p>Hop that helps !&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
