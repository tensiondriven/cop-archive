      <h4>Circles within Anchor Circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>One of my co-workers recently asked me if it was possible to add a 2nd circle in the Anchor circle, besides our GCC. I told him I didn't think so, but I now don't see why it couldn't.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A little back story, our company is a worker-owned cooperative. Everyone in the Anchor Circle are worker-owners. They recently created a role within the Anchor Circle and would like it to be a circle so that when they have meetings, it would be transparent on GlassFrog.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do you guys think? Create a 2nd circle within the Anchor Circle or is it not kosher?</p>    </div>

<p>I have a couple of clarifying questions. What is the purpose of the Anchor Circle (e.g. board)? Is the 2nd proposed circle part of the Company? What role perse in the Anchor Circle are you looking to expand into a 2nd Circle? The answers provide a bit more context to understand your specific situation.</p>      </div>

There appear to be two possible interpretations of the Role "Development Think Tank": 1). Is that it is a Context Link (A Cross Link representing an external special interest group) e.g in H1 the Investor Context Link or the Holacracy Context Link, both these represented groups have an interest in but are not directly part of the company. In which case it would not be possible to expand into a Circle as in a sense they already represent a Circle (Cross-Links and thus context links are essentially special Lead-Links) external of the entire organisation. 2) Is that it is a Defined Role directly related to the company and therefore should essentially not reside in the Anchor Circle but in the General Company Circle (GCC), this would allow it to expand into a Circle (resembling what most would recognize as the Business Development Department of many companies). My intuition tells me that the second is the more accurate in which case you need to transfer the role into the GCC through Governance and then once there go through the appropriate Governance to expand it into a sub-circle (Development Think Tank). Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>When I think of the Anatomy of an Organisation I always fall back on the Anatomy of a Human Being (complex organism): When you look at the Human Systems then you can sort of divide them in three groups: Structural Systems, Coordination Systems, and Containment System, the same is true of an Organisation.</p><p>So to be more precise the Biological Structural Systems paired up to their Organisational counterparts as followed:</p><ul><li>Skeletal System - Business Support</li><li>Muscular System - Business Operations</li><li>Digestive &amp; Urinary Systems - Business Improvement</li><li>Reproductive System - Business Development</li><li>Respiratory System - Business Finance&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Biological Coordination Systems paired up to their Organisational counterparts as followed:</p><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Cardiovascular System - Communication</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Nervous System - Organisation</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Endocrine System - Strategy</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Lymphatic System - Commercial</span></li></ul><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Biological Containment Systems paired up to their Organisational counterparts as followed:</span></p><ul><li>Integumentary System - Legal Framework</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
