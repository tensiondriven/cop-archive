  <dd>How to align roles between multiple circles?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>How would this work? In an organisation there are multiple (&gt;15) fairly similar circles, all focussing on products for customers. These circles have similar roles: product owner, scrum master, tester, developer, etc. Governance meetings in these circles might change the roles, also impacting all other teams that have these roles. If the role of say a scrum master is different in each circle, this may become very complex. How do I keep the role definition aligned between all these circles?</dd>
