  <dd>Going to proposal directly from role description</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>It is not a big thing, but it would be very useful for me, to have possibility to go directly to proposal from role description page. I.e. I do my weekly "role checking" and I have an idea to change one of accountabilities - then I have to go to tensions/proposals/change role/find the name of role/then go to accountability and propose. It would be much easier to just have some button "change this role" in role description - as a direct shortcut. That is just an idea - please use it if you...</dd>
