<p>Hello!&nbsp;We have not shared this not even internally yet. I had mistakenly assumed that it was on Creative Commons and that you could have been interested into a free translation to&nbsp;integrate/compare with no obligation at all. No problem about not using it. Forget about it,&nbsp;looking forward to having soon the "official" translation.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:562713145168686245]&nbsp;Hi, I just wanted to let you know that we have gained traction on this, and the uploading of the French Holacracy Habits is underway.&nbsp; If you email us around the end of the month (at the support email, which I can send you if you need it), we will probably be able to enable them for any organization who asks, as a "beta" feature, while we continue to work on the later habits.</p>      </div>

<p>Sorry about that!&nbsp;&nbsp;Some development changes appear to have accidentally shut that off.&nbsp; I have gone back into the settings for the 3 clients and have made some changes, so they should be good for now.&nbsp; Please email us if they continue to have problems.</p>      </div>
