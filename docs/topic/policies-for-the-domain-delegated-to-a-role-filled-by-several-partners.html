      <h4>Policies for the domain delegated to a role filled by several partners</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>If there is a domain on a role which is filled by several partners, then how do they&nbsp;create and&nbsp;policies for that domain? If it was just one&nbsp;partner, it would have been single person decision. If it was a circle, it would be governance. But in case of one role and several partners — how's that done?</p>    </div>

<p>Hm, is standard process of solving tensions during governance process of the circle the role belongs to not applicable? Just someone filling that role comes up with a tension and proposition to add policy. We have several developers in a circle (that is one of&nbsp;several roles in our circle), so sometimes one of them brings some tension to governance of the circle and proposes some new policies.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:471649920894755840]&nbsp;Great question! This is not specified by the Constitution. If there is any tension within the *team* (I mean all the people filling that role), they will have to figure it out. Often people are assigned with a Focus or something in order to be compliant to what says the Constitution in section 2.4.2 "A Lead Link may assign multiples people to the same Defined Role, as long as that will not decrease the clarity of who should enact the Accountabilities and *authorities* of the Role in common situations." It states "do not decrease the clarity of who should enact *authorities*", creating Policies is part of authorities, right? So maybe there is something to look at in the manner assignment is done.</p>      </div>
