      <h4>How to guide or engage with some one, not taking time as per their contract!</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>If some one in the business is not taking enough roles, and also not giving the time that is expected from them to give, or there is a misunderstanding between the role that hires people or asks them to leave on the amount of energy put by one person. Wondering what can happen in this case.&nbsp;</p><p>Some options, the lead link can talk to them about the priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>If lead link has a sense that the person is not giving as much time that is agreed or that others are putting in then how can it be handled.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have an onboarder role who engages with those coming to internship or volunteering and make agreement for their full time engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>I am looking for ways to engage with people so their gifts can be received while also doing it effectively. I like how in the maturity map for Holacracy it says that in a mature organisation there may not be much of need to dismiss people.&nbsp;</p><p>Look forward to inputs on this.&nbsp;</p><p>Shammi&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>It is true, at maturity level 5 Holacracy does not provide that it is necessary to dismiss people, because it assumes that a person who does not want to participate in the purpose of the organization finds another way independently. In my experience, it is not always possible to convince employees of a company to contribute with their talents to the purpose of the organization; this assumes the presence of widespread leadership, which is usually not present when you move to Holacracy (at maturity level 1). In my experience, people who have not wanted or been able to take on roles aligned with their talent have simply resigned over time.</p>      </div>

<p>I agree with Luca often people don't come into the organization able to interact in this way. I don't have a solution but a few ideas in addition to those proposed.</p><p>Make it contribution levels more transparent through metrics or checklists or another outlet if you have others.</p><p>Offer training, support, and feedback. We have a number of roles doing this kind of work.</p><p>It's easy to assume it's a motivation issue and it might be but don't overlook an ability issue around training to do the job, tools available, and structures to make it possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Last I would say good role fit is important, my experience is if you invite people to show up as leaders in ways that contributes their talents they will provided they know how.&nbsp;</p><p>Also just know for us if this happens it is often a partner's personal issues coming forward and the training, support, feedback roles do help those who want it with personal issues because it's often necessary to get to a place where a partner can bring their whole self.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenn</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:493184366878843164]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:549200391411054975]&nbsp;for ur responses. Jenn, I hear u that a good role fit is important and coupled with training and feedback it works well. Does that mean we need to pick up the right people who fit the role or are interested in it. Diet it mean, No point picking up people who are not interested in certain things and pushing them to do that stuff. Am i understanding u correctly. I am hearing some resonance in this.&nbsp;</p><p>I have some pain around people who r educated(degree), or upper caste, or class are not interested in manual work, which leads to or perpetuates some kind of structural violence. Am still trying to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
