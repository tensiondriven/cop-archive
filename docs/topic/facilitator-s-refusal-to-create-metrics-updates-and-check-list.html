  <dd>Facilitator's refusal to create metrics, updates and check list.</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>What if the facilitator of the general circle says that making metrics, check lists and updates is waste of time and he does not want to spend energy on making them. The others in the cirlce are wanting this to happen. Does that mean the facilitator has to step down, as he or she has signed the constitution before joining the organisation.</dd>
