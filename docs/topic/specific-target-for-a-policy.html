  <dd>Specific target for a policy</dd>

  <dd>Hi, Statement : A GCC Policy applies to all sub-circles by default In a GCC policy you can however target a specific sub-circle Question : How deep (2) can a policy targets ? In other words, can a GCC Policy target on a specific sub-sub-circle ? Is there a limit in this ?</dd>

<p>[@mention:491495232183315418]&nbsp;You may technically refer in a Policy to roles in a sub-sub-...-circle. I don't interpret the constitution disallow that. And for it's certainly something I would find a bit weird, and there may be something to discover deeper. May be a sign the structure could be updated... for allowing better integrity of the holarchy, what&nbsp;[@mention:449693036337664795]&nbsp;refers to as *black box*</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you said, a policy applies to all the sub-circles by default so no need to go deep in the holarchy, you just have to constraint/authorize the upper sub-circle (which is seen as a role from the sub-circle perspective, “tinted windows”, “black box”) and it would apply to all the sub-circles, without targeting anything specific.</p><p>If you could provide more context, that would help.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Margaux, Bernard Marie,</p><p>Thanks for your reply. This "issue" is related to timeline in fact. We have policies that we wanted to apply to specific circles according to their maturity. Naming the concerned circles in the policies was the easiest way for now. For instance some circle's LL are elected.</p><p>It was initially done on sub-circle.</p><p>However we had a proposal that added a layer so we ended up with policy targeting sub-sub-circles, and then I was wandering if that was an issue or not.</p>      </ul>
