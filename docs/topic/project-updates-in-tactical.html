<p>We don't actually use the statuses of project updates. We do updates on any of the projects that have made progress since the last meeting. We have no policies around project reports. Many of our "projects" in glassfrog and in our meetings are really accountabilities; we do it this way because glassfrog doesn't have a explicit functionality for reporting on accountabilities and most of our work is really accountability based and not on temporary projects. We go through the "projects" on a per person basis.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Marco,</p><p>As a general rule, I will ask each role-filler to provide an update on their projects and remind them that the update should be restricted to any changes or updates since our last&nbsp;Tactical meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Early in our practice, I would read each project and ask the role-filler if there were any updates. &nbsp;This practice helped draw attention to each of the individual projects and helped avoid the "no updates on any of my projects" response, which doesn't really allow enough time for the group sense and respond to tensions around the role and or project list.</p><p>I do not skip waiting for or completed projects (I do ask if the completed project can be archived).</p><p>- Dennis&nbsp;</p>      </div>

In iGi's practice, we've not yet sense any tension so we don't do it, unless somebody ask for that (which has never happened up to now). &nbsp;As a consequence of not having sense any tension here, we don't have any Policy.</p>      </div>

<p>&nbsp;Ciao Marco,</p><p>I ask for updates by person and let each person speak, I usually don't read projects one by one but if I did I wouldn't make distinctions &nbsp;by status ( I.e: a project moved to "done" during the week may still make it &nbsp;worth reporting on the delta that brought it there) every once in a while I remind participants that they have the right to ask for updates on projects they are interested in even those that they know exist but are not tracked (yet). Before moving to the next person I usually ask the current speaker if he wants to make any project status changes.</p>      </div>
