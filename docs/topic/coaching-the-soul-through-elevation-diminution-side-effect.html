      <h4>Coaching the Soul through Elevation/Diminution Side Effect</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Folks</p><p>Imagine a hypothetical anchor circle that has been operating more or less with the same structure for 2 years. Minor tweaks and policies and stuff in that time period.</p><p>Governance comes along that moves a handful of roles (some w subcircles) into a new subcircle of the anchor group.</p><p>Humans energizing roles now moved to the subcircle might have an experience (from shadow power or social conditioning?) that they have been demoted / minimized / diminished. Other humans energizing roles in the now-smaller anchor circle might have an experience that they are elevated / superior / more important, from the same traditional rules that make up means about the comparative value of human beings in an organization.</p><p>How might a Holacracy coach work with team and individuals as they face their new structure, the shifting dynamics, and the exposed underbelly of shadow power in the organization and within themselves?</p><p>Your input strongly desired.</p>    </div>
