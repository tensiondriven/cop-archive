<p>[@mention:586501884352325570]&nbsp;Yes, good question. Understanding priorities really require&nbsp;connecting&nbsp;two sections of the constitution. First, as you point out, is the one about the Lead Link having an accountability for defining them.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part you need is 4.1.3(c), which is about the duties every partner has. It says, "<em>(c) Circle Needs Over Individual Goals:&nbsp;You must integrate and align with any official prioritizations or Strategies of the Circle, such as those specified by the Circle’s Lead Link, when assessing how to deploy your time, attention, and other resources to your work within the Circle.</em></p><p>Combining these two sections means that the Lead Link doesn't technically have a domain on setting priorities, but the Lead Link's prioritization is the ONLY ONE a partner must align with. So, technically anyone could give anyone else a prioritization, but technically you have absolutely no obligation to listen to it.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, however, it's effectively like a domain which is why it seems that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Metrics work the same way. The Lead Link doesn't have a domain on them, but 4.1.1(b) and 4.2.1(b) and 4.2.3(c) all state that you only have to report on the ones assigned by the Lead Link.&nbsp;</p><p>So, it's definitely confusing,&nbsp;but that's how I understand it. In summary, while it's not technically a domain, it effectively acts like one.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:586501884352325570]&nbsp;Well, I think the phrase "such as" is used because that authority could be delegated to another role, i.e. removed from the Lead Link.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I appreciate all the comments above, but I would ask this: What tension are you trying to resolve? It seems to me that you would only need the answer to this question if: A. someone other than the lead link is setting priorities and no one knows if they are required to follow them<br />or B. the lead link is failing to set priorities that someone else thinks are necessary.<br />In both cases, I would think that this should be easily resolvable by bringing the tension to the circle.&nbsp;<br />What am I missing here?</p>      </div>

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for clarifying your tension. I'm not an expert and these are just my personal thoughts. I can certainly understand why you would want to thoroughly understand your role, especially as a coach.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />As I see it, priorities and strategies are actually answers to questions. When someone becomes confused about the way they should make decisions within their role such that they support the purpose of the organization, or if there is a tension that decisions&nbsp;could be&nbsp;better aligned with the purpose of the organization, those questions are answered with priorities and strategies, usually (but perhaps not always) set by the lead link.<br /><br />Also, I think that priorities and strategies could sometimes be interpreted as personal guidelines that each role determines for themselves in fulfilling their purpose, only to be changed if there is a tension associated with them.&nbsp;<br />It occurs to me that the idea of setting priorities and strategies absent any tension could be a legacy of top down thinking.</p><p>Perhaps the constitution is vague on this point because it kind of depends on the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes sense for the lead link (as responsible for the whole circle) to be responsible for priorities and strategies within that circle. But there may be situations where others need to take that responsibility. Also, roles within the circle are supposed to have authority to do things their own way as long as the purpose of their role is filled, so giving the lead link absolute authority over strategies could be in violation of that IF there is no tension to resolve.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm curious to know what others think about this.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>      </div>

<p>The experience I've had is that since the Lead Link holds the role of the circle...the super circle created a role that became a circle and the LL holds that role. The super circle articulate the purpose (raison d'etre) for that circle, and that is used to prioritize the output of that circle. Given that the LL is fully accountable for all outcomes of that circle on behalf of the Super Circle, it functions pretty well to have them hold the functional responsibility of prioritization.&nbsp;<br />In practice, prioritization is held by the people doing the work until their work is no longer fulfilling the purpose of the circle (the LL's purpose). Once a role is not delivering what is expected, the LL takes a more active role in that roles outputs...which often includes prioritization.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
