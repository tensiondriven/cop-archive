      <h4>Language localizations and approach to multi-language organization</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all, I have a question on behalf of an organization adopting Holacracy in an italian branch as the result of an acquisition. The question is multifaceted because it also involves the translation of the Constitution to italian.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This organization represents an interesting case because it will adopt GlassFrog in Italy, while it is already using it in the States, and meetings will be held in different languages (and please be aware that some partners do not speak english, and maybe never will, and will keep on running their meetings exclusively in italian).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the question:</p><p>- is GlassFrog localized? (or is there an intention/possibility to localize it to different languages?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my translation of the Constitution I have translated many of the keywords to italian (updating a mapping file that was shared with me by Olivier Compagne) , now I am thinking about replacing them the original english version and then just add their translation,&nbsp;within parentheses when they are first mentioned,&nbsp;in order to ease the learning process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp;Since others have translated the Constitution to other languages how are they managing the use of GlassFrog (maybe by simply mapping concepts on their own side?).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am open to ideas, or solutions if someone has already dealt with these issues within multinational companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>we are working with Holacracy in Switzerland, where lots of languages come together (mostly German, Swiss German, and English but als French and Italian). We are holding meetings in German and English. I am anticipating problems but so far everything went rather smoothly.</p><p>Until now we are using glassfrog, the constitution and training cards only in English but I am interested in finding translations. Could you make yours available? That would help us tremendously.</p><p>Cheers</p><p>Frederik</p>      </div>

<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, I've been posting in the wrong discussion thread about internationalization and GlassFrog: <a href="/topic/hola-spirit-web-tool?reply=471368445536914326#471368445536914326" target="_blank"><a href="...6#471368445536914326" target="_blank">...6#471368445536914326</a></a>.
