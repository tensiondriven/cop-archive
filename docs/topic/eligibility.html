      <h4>Eligibility</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I&nbsp;would like to double check with the CoP, my understanding of the last paragraph of 2.5.1 "Elections &amp; Eligibility"</p><p>"All Core Circle Members are eligible for election" for me does not mean that ONLY Core Circle Members are eligible, but it means that everyone who is a Core Circle Members, even if temporarily, has the right to be elected.&nbsp; It does&nbsp;NOT exclude non-Core Circle Members from the election.</p><p>Furthermore, 3.3.1 "Attendance" is also talking about the possibility that the Facilitator and the Secretary are not Core Circle Members.&nbsp;That&nbsp;does reinforce my understanding in that way.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, I think in general that might not be a&nbsp;great idea to have a&nbsp;Rep Link that is not a "stable"&nbsp;core circle member, because of the need of understanding of the tensions of the other members. However, I do not see why a Facilitator or a Secretary should be stable members of the circle if some external people are seen&nbsp;as the best fit for those roles. And actually, even for a Rep Link, the same reasoning should apply.&nbsp;</p><p>And there is always the possibility to object during the Integrative Election Process&nbsp;or to call for other elections if needed.</p><p>Please let me know your understanding about that.</p>    </div>

<p>HI Francesco,</p><p>Yes 2.5.1 says it&nbsp;to my own brain&nbsp;by adding up the logic implied in the two sentences:</p><p>...will facilitate regular elections to elect a Core Circle Member of the Circle</p><p>....All Core Circle Members are eligible for election</p><p>If there wasn't such a limitation I would have phrased things differently (that is if I was the author of such a passage)</p><p>Andrea.</p>      </div>

<p>I see what you mean, but I still stick to my interpretation because if I had written the Constitution I would have stated clearly that ONLY Core Circle Members are eligible. In any case I think that it is necessary to remove that ambiguity. Version 5?</p>      </div>

<p>It is just my feeling, but I feel that "external" Secretary of Facilatator are much better than "internal" because they have only their common sense and Constitution and they don't mix their own opinion to the discussion... <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>

<p>Funny you mention "opinions" Mikolaj. We actually had some mindgames if the Facilitator should be a (software) bot, because of what he has to do and what the Circle is expecting from him (acting cold-bloded, follow process, don't have feelings nor opinions). Maybe in 2-4 years Slackbot, Alexa and friends will be able to facilitate Governance- and Tactical-Meetings <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>

<p>I was in a circle where I lost all other roles (circle retired them by governance) except the role as secretary.

<p>Hi Francesco my understanding is the following:</p><p>as a general statement: non-core circle members cannot be elected,&nbsp;</p><p>however :</p><p>Any "non-core" circle member (or shall I say literally "anyone")&nbsp; &nbsp;may become "core" by simply being invited via one of the available means provided by&nbsp; articles&nbsp; <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2.3.4</a> (..."additional persons"...) and <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art413" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4.1.4</a> (..."someone else"...). This&nbsp;to my eyes makes&nbsp; the distinction substantially irrelevant for the purpose of elections,&nbsp; &nbsp;As a matter of fact as you correctly say for&nbsp;&nbsp;training or other purposes you might want to have external facilitators and secretaries or to rotate them between circles.</p><p>Then I agree with you, electing an external Rep Link might not be a smart move, but who knows, what if&nbsp;a good number of circle member believes&nbsp; someone external, once invited to the meeting,&nbsp; could be a good tension ambassador candidate for the Super Circle ;-)? And even in that case the rep link can always invite someone who might help him in processing specific tensions (i.e. think of some domain expert in the Circle that could help describing the nature of the tension to the containing Circle for it to be better processed there)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>PS: [@mention:551171168851329852]&nbsp;article 4.1.4 is not linkable externally (i had to point to 4.1.3) due to a typo in the id field of the corresponding html tag.</p><p>&nbsp; (&lt;a <span class="html-attribute-name">id</span>="<span class="html-attribute-value">art414-</span>" , that dash&nbsp;seems to mess up things when linking)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>It's clear to me that only core circle members are eligible. If an individual is not a member of the circle by nature of role assignment, a lead link can appoint them as a core circle member, making them eligible for election to one of the elected roles.</p><p>Re: the thread, I very much like the idea of 'neutral' Facilitator and Secretary - IF your organization has the human resources to implement such a thing. BUT there's nothing requiring your other circle members to nominate someone who doesn't also energize a role in the circle.</p>      </div>
