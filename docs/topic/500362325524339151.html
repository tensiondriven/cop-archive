  <dd>An update on our journey with Holacracy</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Why Holacracy? We aspire to be a global completions enterprise that assists stakeholders to make a meaningful difference. We needed a way of working that aligned to our cultural belief of breaking down the 20th century concept of hierarchy of people and positions, but still held people accountable through clarity of roles and accountabilities. Also the benefit of breaking down silos by allowing people to be spread amongst a wider breadth of the organisation and hence increasing productivity.</dd>
