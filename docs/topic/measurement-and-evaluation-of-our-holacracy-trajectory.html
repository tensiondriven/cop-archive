      <h4>Measurement and Evaluation of our holacracy trajectory</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>HI all,</p><p>This question&nbsp;stems from us developing as an organization and trying to build a larger evaluative&nbsp;framework.&nbsp; I am wondering what&nbsp;measures&nbsp;people&nbsp;are using. I am thinking about measures in two main buckets to help me process this idea. I think the first bucket (holacracy) is part of the other larger bucket (mission and vision attainment) but I am calling them out as different for the purpose of asking the COP about them.</p><ul><li>The first bucket I want to measure is holacracy&nbsp;adoption. In this bucket, I want to understand how people are measuring their progress organizationally. I see some tools for tracking how far along the&nbsp;roadmap&nbsp;to adopting we might be: <ol><li>Competency model: <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/resource/competency-model/">https://www.holacracy.org/resource/competency-model/</a></li><li>Self organization maturity map: <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/resource/self-organization-maturity-map/">https://www.holacracy.org/reso...zation-maturity-map/</a></li><li>Others I am missing?</li></ol></li></ul><p><strong>Do any of you have examples of how you measure or evaluate yourselves against some of the “levels” in the tools?</strong></p><ul><li>The second bucket for me is Organizational mission and vision. In this bucket, I see a number of ways that people might be thinking about this. For example, Kickstarter, (not using holacracy) has a great mission and vision page where they call out their goals explicitly so they can measure against them (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/charter?ref=global-footer" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/charter?ref=global-footer</a>).</li></ul><p><strong>How are you evaluating your team’s movement towards your mission and vision? Does your larger evaluation strategy include measures targeting your adoption of holacracy (as well as financial stability, staffing, project delivery etc)?</strong></p><p>I am relatively new to larger quality improvement, measurement, and evaluation systems and I appreciate your comments and replies as we start to wade into this territory.</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Sam</p><p>Some&nbsp;question regarding the first bucket</p><p>Did anyone define what level of adoption should be targeted (maybe from the ratifiers)? Is there any budget allocated for improvements? Should people (employees?) care about that level? Did they sign something were they declare to pursuit holacracy and its goals? Are there incentives to invest time into a good holacracy practice?</p><p>(Those questions surfaced in our company after a couple of months living with holacracy)</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you for the insights Sam.</p><p>For the first bucket, we started with Holacracy because of a strategical evaluation process where assumptions where made why it could help us (things like: let the people who work directly with the customer make the&nbsp;decisions rather than management to increase customer satisfaction).</p><p>This is a very personal feeling, but I think it's pointless to measure how good Holacracy was adopted but to measure what you achieved with it and how it contributes to bucket number two goals. IMHO Holacracy practice should not be implemented for a selfpurpose but to bring added value for your organisation =&gt; this needs to be measured.</p><p>We have let go of our old Vision and Mission statement and defined a Why, how, what (Simon Sinek). We have no measures yet for this. I can imagine very well we will never reach "highest level" Holacracy implementation to align it with our business goals. There is just no actual tension to reach a higher level&nbsp;than lets say level 3 as an example if it&nbsp;fits the company.</p><p>Happy to hear other thoughts</p>      </div>

<p>Fritz,</p><p>I agree that there is no need to achieve&nbsp;higher levels unless it meets business goals. I guess I was making the assumption that the higher up the trajectory the "better" we are doing... as you say, that might not be the case. Certainly if where we are is working for us, there may be no need to change.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank&nbsp;you for helping me to pause and consider that!</p><p>I wondering&nbsp;if anybody has tied moving up those levels to&nbsp;something they are measuring.&nbsp; It sounds like&nbsp;you are not.&nbsp; We are in the process of starting some coordinated strategic planning discussions with an outside facilitator&nbsp;and will report back here&nbsp;if and when we have&nbsp;ideas to push this forward.</p><p>In the meantime, if anyone else has evaluation&nbsp;ideas or examples, I would appreciate hearing about them.</p><p>Sam</p>      </div>

<p>Nice questions Fritz,</p><p>I will take them back to the team to discuss;</p><p>"Did anyone define what level of adoption should be targeted (maybe from the ratifiers)? Is there any budget allocated for improvements?"</p><p>We wanted full adoption but we never defined what that would look like (sigh).&nbsp; We don't have a clarified budget per se but we have been able to pay people and make&nbsp;time/space to work on aspects of implementation.&nbsp; For example, I could likely&nbsp;make the case for a budget for coaching if we felt that was necessary... but that would require a gap we wanted to close that we felt could be filled by coaches.&nbsp; Without a roadmap to success or evaluation,&nbsp;I cannot make that case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Should people (employees?) care about that level? Did they sign something were they declare to pursuit holacracy and its goals? Are there incentives to invest time into a good holacracy practice?"</p><p>Great questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea came from the team when we engaged them around org development.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;not signed anything but we have had pretty good buy in.&nbsp; I think the incentives are clarity in roles and in expectations (but that might just be me). I think everyone has seen some reward from implementation but I haven't explicitly asked.&nbsp; I will do so this afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>      </div>
