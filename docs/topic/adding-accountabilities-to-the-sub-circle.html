      <h4>Adding accountabilities to the sub-circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello colleagues! Suppose that at the governance meeting of the super-circle it was decided to add a new accountability to one of the sub-circles. Do I understand correctly that the lead-link of the sub-circle must itself fulfill this accountability and transfer this accountability to one of the roles of the sub-circle it can only through a governance meeting? Or is there another way?&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you!</p>    </div>

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but since the lead link is assigned from the super circle into the lead link role of the sub Circle and the replink attends the governance meeting where the decision takes place, once it clears governance, the remaining process is either for the lead link who accepted the accountability onto the subcircle to fulfill it (since it's undifferentiated), or for the lead link and rep link bring the need for either a new role or the assignment of the accountability to a role or various roles to the sub circles governance process.      </div>

<p>[@mention:558068091793200931]&nbsp;Short answer is yes - Sub-circle's LL has to go to governance to update role(s) in order to make sure the structure of sub-circle may enact such new accountability placed onto the circle.</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks for the answer! If I understand correctly, on the governance of the sub-circle the lead-link should make a proposal to add this accountability for one of the roles or create a new role. But what if the proposal on the sub-circle governance is rejected or a modified proposal is accepted? Rep-link of the sub-circle should come up with a new tension on the governance of the super-circle?</p>      </div>

I am struggling to imagine why such a proposal for a new role with a new accountability should fail to pass the governance of the sub-circle. The new accountability is a mandate for the circle. If the LL fails to bring his unpacking proposal through governance (again: for what reason???) he/she should simply keep trying to process it into a role at the next meeting. In the meantime, the supercircle will still continue to expect this new accountability of the circle and the LL has to hold it until it is delegated to a new or an existing role.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
