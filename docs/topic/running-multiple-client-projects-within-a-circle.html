      <h4>Running multiple client projects within a circle</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi we are considering&nbsp;Holacracy as a tool for organisational structure and governance within our team of circa 20&nbsp;people.</p><p>Having read a lot, watched videos and played with GlassFrog&nbsp;we are considering creating a circle for each of our cross-disciplinary&nbsp;delivery teams - typically 3-6 people. However these teams work on multiple concurrent client projects of all sizes and complexities.</p><p>Circles&nbsp;seemingly fit well for governance of teams within the organisation however&nbsp;I'm interested how other organisations structure their client work within these circles.</p><ul><li>Should we just use projects within the main circle?</li><li>or should we create new sub circles (with specific roles and accountabilities) for every client project?</li></ul><p>Roles and accountabilities may vary between projects, or require only a subset of the team so clarity over who is doing what on each client project is important for us.</p><p>Alternatively&nbsp;we could continue to manage&nbsp;our client work / task allocation outside&nbsp;of GlassFrog and keep it just for governance?</p><p>Any advice or experience would help&nbsp;us understand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
