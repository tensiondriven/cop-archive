<p>His Email did not work...</p><p>Can you forward this:&nbsp;</p><div class="gmail_default">Hi Ken,</div><div class="gmail_default">I read "requisite LEadership" by Jaques and I have to say I was thrilled to learn about the different strata. I feel aslo that it would make sense to attribute roles a strata/time horizon. Otherwise I loose an opportunity to make a good fit between role filler and role. I just need to find out reliable ways to assess strata with employees.&nbsp;</div><div class="gmail_default">&nbsp;</div><div class="gmail_default">What are your thoughts?</div><div class="gmail_default">&nbsp;</div><div class="gmail_default">Max</div>      </ul>

<p>Many years ago I trained with Jaques. There are lots of resources. Currently we've a couple of clients who are integrating aspects of Requisite Org. , Teal with a touch of Holacracy. Can you imagine how much we're having. Would be pleased to chat about with anyone who's willing.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
