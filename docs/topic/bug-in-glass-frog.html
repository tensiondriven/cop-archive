      <h4>Bug in Glass Frog</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I was creating an initial organizational structure.&nbsp; I created a first defined role in a governance meeting and closed the meeting.&nbsp; The new role immediately appeared&nbsp; in the list of roles as a Defined Role.&nbsp; However, the role didn't show up on the picture representation of the organizational structure for at least 10 minutes causing 2 of us to keep trying new things to try to get it to show up or figure out what we were doing wrong.</p><p>I called another user of GlassFrog on the phone. He created a new role and it also didn't show up in his organization's structure either though he's created new roles in the past and had them show up.</p><p>This seems to be a bug?</p><p>Thanks, P</p>    </div>
