  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I recall in the book a section on how the team can identify and safely discuss under perfomers but unfortunately someone has borrowed my book and I can't look up the answer - is anyone able to let me know in their experience if there is a mechanism/strategy/approach to dealing with under performers?</dd>
