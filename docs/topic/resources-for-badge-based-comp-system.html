      <h4>Resources for Badge-Based Comp System</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I'm about to introduce the Badge-Based Comp system at our company and looking for additional resources to help people get it.</p><p><strong>What resources you could share to help with the implementation?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Materials I have found so far:</strong></p><p>The <a href="http://hbadges.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">H1 Badge database</a> is public and has many great examples.</p><p>I found a link to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/holacracyone.com/file/d/0BymXxFXb0ha5TWhVVE42UGh4S1k/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Walkthrough of Badge-Based Comp System</a> at H1's <a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/28174?locale=en" target="_blank">Compensation Architect</a>&nbsp;role.&nbsp;Brian, would you share that publicly?</p><p>H1's Badge criteria:</p><blockquote><p>- A badge should include a stand alone description of a single measurable or objective/definable skill/skill set.<br />- A badge should be described in one sentence ideally, or succinct bullets.<br />- A badge should be something that is either already being expressed in the organization, or a missing skill requested by a role with the authority to assign partners to roles.<br />- Optimal badges have only one skill set. So a project manager could possibly define a "Vendor Liaison" badge as part of it, and actual planning and driving toward outcomes to meet stakeholder needs as another part.<br />- If a badge has any “levels” associated they must each be a “stand alone” skill set, with clear and distinct difference between levels. So you want to create a badge level 4, you would also need to create level 1-3. Levels are not applicable unless they build on each other.</p></blockquote>    </div>
