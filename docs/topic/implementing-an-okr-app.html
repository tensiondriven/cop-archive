  <dd>Implementing an OKR app</dd>

  <dd>Hi! My General Circle LeadLink would like to use OKR for our organisation but we do not really had ideas how to implement it... The proposal was ' every circle set its OKR and must do everything to reach them.' The tension was something like 'we do not have OKR, i think it is great to set them'. Named role feeling the tension: Leadlink. My question is, is there apps or do you have any idea how to build an OKR governance?</dd>
