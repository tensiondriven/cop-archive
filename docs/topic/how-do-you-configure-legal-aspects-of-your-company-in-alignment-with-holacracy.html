      <h4>How do you configure LEGAL aspects of your company in alignment with Holacracy?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi,</p><p>Our team (based in Hong Kong) is committed to organizing ourselves using Holacracy. When we create legal documents we realize that often it is necessary to go through a reinterpretation of the legality.</p><p>For example:</p><p>*1.* Agreements (incl. contacts) are embedded in and reconciled with our Constitution and governance process.</p><p>*2.* That agreements have a way to evolve and develop in accordance to our governance process and with changing contexts</p><p>*3.* That tensions, aka disagreements are resolved not primarily through legal action or even mediation, but rather through the governance process itself, perhaps a very specific and designed process accounting for a few levels of not resolving the tension.</p><p>*4.* That the language and style of agreements reflect our maturity and purpose.</p><p>In this way agreements can actually evolve, meaning the starting points don't need to be as complex and artificial, in that they then don't need to account for every future eventuality.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems that we are in the face of the task of the development of a Teal/Holacracy legal philosophy and then strategy. That requires someone who understands deeply how companies comply legally to currently policies, but can develop new strategies / practices with a deep understanding of Holacracy and Teal philosophy.&nbsp;</p><p>We would very much need to draw on the intelligence in this community. Has your company gone through a similar process? What is your experience? What legal support did you receive? Any pointers that you can share?&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
