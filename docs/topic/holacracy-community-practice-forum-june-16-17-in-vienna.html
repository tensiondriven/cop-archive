      <h4>Holacracy Community Practice Forum, June 16-17 in Vienna</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi Folks,</p><p>we are pleased to announce the 2016 <a href="http://www.holacracypracticeforum.org" target="_blank">Holacracy Community Practice Forum</a>, June 16-17, 2016, in Vienna, Austria.</p><p>Holacracy practitioners from all over the world will gather together for two days of workshops, good-practice exchange, and&nbsp;in-depth conversations&nbsp;in an uplifting, inspirational environment.</p><p>The event focuses on two aspects of the powershift:</p><ol><li>Practice: high-quality mechanics&nbsp;exchange (questions related to "how do we shift management-systems to foster&nbsp;self-organizing&nbsp;principles?" - "Apps" such as Performance Mgt, Compensation, Budgeting, Team Work, Leadership from Roles etc.), and &nbsp;</li><li>Practitioner: sharing stories, experiences, tools from the "I"-Space. In self-organizing systems it becomes even more important how we show up as individuals, how we develop our capacity of self-leadership and guiding others in that transition, and how we grow the global community. We aim to have&nbsp;deep conversations about that individual development journey as well.</li></ol><p>Attendees should be active or former Holacracy practitioners who are interested in sharing and learning to advance the practice of Holacracy as a way to accelerate powershifts in organizations around the world.</p><p>We are at the moment drafting&nbsp;the overall conference flow and will invite the community to co-create with their inputs. <a href="http://www.holacracypracticeforum.org" target="_blank">Subscribe here to stay tuned</a>!</p><p>Use the opportunity to visit one of the World's Top 3 cities to live in!&nbsp;The forum is hosted by dwarfs and Giants in association with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.encode.org/" target="_blank">encode.org</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://energized.org/" target="_blank">energized.org</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://igipartners.com/" target="_blank">iGi Partners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://arca.com/" target="_blank">ARCA</a>&nbsp;and powered by Unicredit Austria Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope to meet you in Vienna!
