  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, I work for a traditional top down organization and am very intrigued with the notion of holacracy. I am not a manager so I don't have say in my organization, and when I tried to propose a change recently, my manager and his boss both dismissed my proposal as trying to "get my way." What I would like to know is whether my interpretation of the book Holacracy is accurate for the situation I am experiencing at work. In the organization that I work for, the writer does, and I think should,...</dd>

<p>I can say that if you were using Holacracy, you'd likely have clear roles for Peer Reviewer and Writer and Editor and you'd have a clearly defined purpose and set of accountabilities to help guide the circumstance. &nbsp;<br /><br />If a Writer had an accountability of "Considering and incorporating feedback from Peer Reviewer" then it would eliminate some of the back and forth in deciding what is right for the situation. Perhaps Editor has final say. Or maybe the Writer has no accountability to incorporate, only to consider. Some of this dynamic is already at play in the situation you described, it is just much more informal and likely to change depending on mood and perceived authority.&nbsp;<br /><br />Basically what you're describing is what we call a tension. A&nbsp;tension can be taken to governance and tactical meetings to be resolved. &nbsp;If the roles and accountabilities as they stand are giving rise to tensions, then they can be changed until you find the right solution.</p><p>In my opinion that's the smartest thing about Holacracy. The process allows a team to "home in" on the correct answer simply by processing tensions through a clearly defined process.&nbsp;<br /><br />Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Thanks! What you say makes sense, it's just a bit hard to picture because I have never experienced it . I would love to, though. It sounds liberating and empowering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am already trying to plant some holacracy seeds with my boss, as I wrote up a proposal that includes the integrative decision making process. I think it is the most likely part of holacracy to pique his interest because he hates it when people, myself included, tend to bring up side issues when we are trying to solve a problem. He is a big advocate for solving one problem at a time and I think the integrative decision making process would help with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
