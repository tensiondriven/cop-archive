  <dd>Purpose of the circle member (role-filler)</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I realize in coaching of structures that the participants have difficulty integrating the duties and responsibilities of member and role. I wanted to give a clear sentence on these accountabilities. I have extracted (here below) what the constitution says about it. In particular 1.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF ROLE-FILLING and 4.1 DUTIES OF CIRCLE MEMBERS. I found that neither the purpose of the circle member nor that of the role-filling are written. This is why I wonder what is the purpose of a...</dd>

<p>What we did was essentially describe all in one place those duties and responsibilities and incorporate that and a couple other requirements (basic study of Holacracy, commitment to ongoing study of Holacracy, commitment to a few practices regarding absence coordination and team communication) all into a Partner Agreement, which we require PRIOR to that individual being 'Eligible' to be a Partner. Only individuals who are eligible can be appointed as circle members or to individual Roles.</p>      </ul>

<p>Responsibilities and duties are like Rights and Obligations.<br />Article 1.2 clarifies what a role is entitled to do (i.e. processing and tracking tensions, purpose, accountabilities and projects).<br />When you’re on your own, you don’t have any obligations towards others (because there is no ‘others’). In most organizations this is not the case. A role has been granted to you by another role (or circle). So there are ‘others’ (roles, members, partners). Even within a decentralized context of a for-the-purpose organization there must be some kind of coordinating mechanism. This is where obligations come into play (duties in article 4.1: transparency, processing, prioritization).<br /><br />It seems to me superfluous to have a purpose ‘enact [..] in order to realize the purpose of the organization’ (because that purpose was the reason that your role was established).<br />The same goes for ’taking into account the needs of other [..]’. The constitution is all about ’taking into account of others’; not for the sake of others, but for the purpose and based on clear and specific ruleset. 'Taking into account' can have a lot of different meanings, leading to more confusion (instead of solving it).<br /><br />..on the other hand; If your proposal will reduce the tension behind it (puzzlement around responsibilities and duties of roles and members), go for it.</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;I like what you're trying to do. I didn't review it in depth (just skimmed through it), but I wanted to offer a thought: I think it can be very valuable, but in your effort make sure to not mix the Holacracy constitutional requirements and other things you'd like to expect that aren't constitutional (e.g. commitment to ongoing study of Holacracy,&nbsp;<span>commitment to a few practices regarding absence coordination and team communication, etc.)</span></p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:456308404254624012]&nbsp;Simply so that people know where these expectations come from, can assess their legitimacy and appropriateness, and choose to process any tensions they may have about them. Basically because of what <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art415" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">article 4.1.5</a> of the constitution says: "<span>Implicit Expectations Hold No Weight"</span></p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:449411339497350002]&nbsp;I wonder what's the harm coming from mixing expectations from the constitution and other sources?</p><p>The harm I imagine from keeping them separate is a steeper learning curve for&nbsp;people joining the company.</p>      </ul>
