  <dd>That one compensation APP</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>When learning Holacracy, I remember someone mentioned that one of the companies determines&nbsp;compensation by asking people to vote on each other.&nbsp; It is neither the Badge-based Compensation App nor the ARCA Compensation App. It involves a software algorithm that calculate salaries based on everyone's opinion of each other. Does any one know which company uses this algorithm and where to find it? &nbsp;</dd>
