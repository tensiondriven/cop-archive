      <h4>Using integrative decision making For design interior software architecture</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Has anyone ever used IDM outside of the governance meeting?&nbsp; One of the dreaded meeting in our company is architecture brainstorming meeting, where several role, discuss to solve a problem affecting the software that they maintain. It often spans to 2-3 meetings with after meeting discussion in between.</p><p>The last topic on such meeting was pricing. Sales role which maintain website propose to extract pricing module from the website into separate service to be maintain by revenue role whose accountable for supporting business role. Currently revenue role will modify the website and request sales role to deploy the changes since only sales role can modify website.&nbsp;</p><p>We tried IDM, and we reach decision within a single meeting. So we really glad about it, and think there are still some ideas to improve it even more. So has anyone ever tried similar approach? Any tips to run the meeting ? Or maybe we can just use governance meeting format altogether?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>I&nbsp;like the thought. IMHO IDM is capable of accelerating decision-making in a lot or even most (business) situations - BUT would you consider "negotiating" with your wife or children like this? And if not, why would you hesitate?</p><p>There are situations where you're better of with consent (/majority) rather than lowering concerns of stakeholders. Often IDM does not build trust between stakeholders, but sometimes you need trust, sometimes you want everybody (or at least most) in the same boat and have their committment - then it's worth going the extra mile rather than just cut the path short.</p><p>Architecture might be a very good example. What if people loose faith in product because to many decisions where made against their "gut-feeling"? Will they loose interest because they don't feel like its their product anymore?</p><p>We used IDM for other situations too (architecture / tool-decisions) and it worked well. Only problem we experienced was because there are mostly no roles and no explicit purpose in the context testing of objection was not that easy</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you for sharing your thought as well. So do you use IDM for architecture changes decision? How do you validate objections? Currently we use these: security, scalability, dependency, and duplication.</p>      </div>

<p>That's were we failed (or at least it felt awkward): we used the usual process with "causing harm / moving backwards". Not good criterias, I like your approach to define new ones which fit for the according purpose.</p><p>Using good practices quality criterias- I like *thumbs-up*</p>      </div>
