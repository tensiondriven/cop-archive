<p>Hi!</p><p>We wanted to know why Secretary doesn't have this domain:</p><p><span style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">All constitutionally-required meetings of the Circle</span></p><p><span style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">//OR</span></p><p><span style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">All constitutionally-required meetings planifications of the Circle</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He only is accountable of&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">Scheduling the Circle’s required meetings, and notifying all Core Circle Members of scheduled times and locations</span></p>    </div>

<p>I have always thought that this is to allow others to also schedule meetings without having explicit permission from the secretary. Although if the intent was to distribute authorities, this doesn't seem to do it.</p><p>The same question I guess holds for the Lead Link as well. &nbsp;The Lead Link's only domain is "Role Assignment within the circle". The LL does not have strategy, or budget, or metrics domain, only accountabilities.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:549200391377900110]&nbsp;It's true that it's not obvious and could be clearer (you can propose improvements <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution" target="_blank">here</a>!) But the key is in the constitution.</p><p>Several rules of the constitution&nbsp;are tied to the Secretary or, to use&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353]'s example, to the Lead Link.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a governance&nbsp;meeting is only valid if the Secretary has called it:</p><blockquote><h4>3.3.2 Notice &amp; Quorum</h4><p>A Circle may only conduct its Governance Process in a meeting if the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary</span> has given all Core Circle Members reasonable advance notice that a Governance Meeting will be held, including its time and location.</p></blockquote><p>Or metrics are only required if&nbsp;the Lead Link has assigned&nbsp;them:</p><blockquote><h4>4.1.1 Duty of Transparency</h4><p>... <strong>(d) Checklist Items &amp; Metrics:</strong>&nbsp;... You must also track and report on any metrics assigned to your Roles by the Circle’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lead Link</span>, or by any other Role or process granted the authority to define the Circle’s metrics.</p></blockquote>      </div>
