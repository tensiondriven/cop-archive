      <h4>Day to day activities of a former VP of Engineering (or other)</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I am curious, and hoping someone can share his/her experience or witness the changes in day to day activities of someone who used to be Head of a department (or VP of xxx) after the organization has implement Holacracy transformation successfully.&nbsp;</p><p>I am guessing, he or she will start as LL of a circle, then gradually his or her accountability got extracted into separate roles. And if somehow he or she is able to find other partner to fill in those roles, then the "only" thing left to do is LL's accountabilities. Am I right? What do you feel? Do you have (slight) feeling of being useless, as most of decision or operational issues are taken care of?</p>    </div>
