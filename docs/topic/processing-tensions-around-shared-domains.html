  <dd>We have a small school and we are working to implement holacracy. We have a tension around playground care, upkeep of the playground, and the budget for new playground materials. Currently there is no defined role that holds the domain of the playground spaces. One of the spaces is used by the co teacher role in all three classrooms and the other space is only used by the co teacher role in two of the three classrooms. The tension involves the spaces not being well cared for or tended but we...</dd>

<p>You might try a circle policy instead of a domain Jenn, along with a role with accountabilities for supporting the space. This role could be multi filled or even filled by everyone.</p><p>The policy could say "you may only use the play ground if you enlist the help of another (role name) and help clean up after yourself."</p><p>Or&nbsp;</p><p>"Coteachers may only use classroom space if they follow the use checklist created by (role name)."</p><p>Also, consider&nbsp;dropping the tension about domains and try crafting a role to steward the space and develop the budget. Focus on purpose (what would wild success look like) and accountabilities (what you want to expect on an ongoing basis) and leave the space role at that for now perhaps.</p><p>Process controlling or constraining space usage separately from keeping it up, and it may come together down the road.</p><p>Let me know if this helps!</p>      </ul>
