      <h4>What's your process for Role Allocation?</h4>

<p>Hello Holacracy&nbsp;Practitioners</p><p>In our organization currently, the Lead Link&nbsp;assigns people to roles without any defined criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>The tension is it feels like the old Management Hierarchy where the Manager decides who does what by allocating it.</p><p>I'm looking to evolve our process of Role Allocation.</p><p>I'd like to start out with something simple that gives a voice to the&nbsp;person to accept the role, and some kind of process / criteria when&nbsp;assigning or removing a person&nbsp;from a role.</p><p>I'm looking for inspiration from other practitioners on what processes you're using to (re)allocate people to roles.&nbsp;</p><p>thanks,</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Ali - To echo Bernard Marie's point, they already need to accept the role assignment,&nbsp;unless they've agreed otherwise (e.g. in an employment contract).&nbsp; But I'd like to add another caution here: it sounds like you're motivated to design something here based on principle, so that it feels less like a management hierarchy.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;often a trap; the goal of Holacracy is not to make things feel less like a management hierarchy or remove management hierarchy dynamics - it's to enable a company to more effectively organize around a purpose.&nbsp; Is the role assignment process you use now getting in the way of expressing that purpose somehow?&nbsp; Do you have a concrete example of&nbsp;how that happened, in a&nbsp;specific case (or many cases)?&nbsp; Or is it just that it feels like the old&nbsp;approach and&nbsp;you want to evolve it from principle?&nbsp; If it's&nbsp;the latter, I'd say resist the urge.&nbsp; If it's the former and you do have a concrete example of where the current approach actually got in the way of getting the work done (not just "it felt like the old way"), then&nbsp;go looking for a solution to that specific tension; know what you're trying to solve for, so you can assess potential approaches against the real tension.</p><p>Good luck!</p>      </div>

<p>We use the constitutional default for most roles,&nbsp;plus <a href="https://app.preview.glassfrog.com/policies/3625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this policy</a>.&nbsp; However, a small handful of our roles have a different role assignment rule just for that role, such as <a href="https://app.preview.glassfrog.com/policies/4317" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;- Your comment is very useful and at the same time, I find that very often, ex-CEOs adopting Holacracy sense tensions re the fact people still look at them for approval and, then may decide to "burn some bridges" for reducing the old hierarchical&nbsp;power dynamics and mental models, and easing the new "from roles" power structure. All of that in order to allow a better expression of the Org. purpose through Holacracy tension processing practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
