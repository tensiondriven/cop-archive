      <h4>Absentee Ballots</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all</p><p>I was asked a question by a client today to which I didn't find a clear answer. If a core circle member is not able to participate in a Governance Meeting and they know there will be an election, are they allowed to send an absentee ballot via another circle member?&nbsp;</p><p>In this&nbsp;specific case it's about the election of a Rep Link during a launch week. We weren't able to&nbsp;prevent some people from being&nbsp;affected by overlapping meetings, so it's physically impossible for them to attend both meetings simultaneously.</p><p>I could neither find anything about this in the constitution, nor here in the forum.</p><p>3.2.2 and 3.2.4d suggest that all tensions in Governance must be role based. Then again elections seem to a special case to me, as <em>people</em> are electing somebody into a role. In 3.3.6 it doesn't say anything about about absentee circle members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Of course one could argue, that if one of the missing members sees their roles limited by the election, they could always ask for a new election in the next meeting. But that would make the whole process very heavy.</p><p>Has anybody run into a similar situation? How have you handled it? I'm also interested in your interpretations of the constitution as to why his should or shouldn't be allowed.</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>Patrick</p>    </div>
