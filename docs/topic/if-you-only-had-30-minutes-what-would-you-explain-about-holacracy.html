<p>If you only have 30 minutes to tell somebody about Holacracy, &nbsp;what are the main things you would want to be sure to convey? &nbsp;I find myself in this situation every so often and am curious what this community recommends. &nbsp;<br /><br />One thing I find it useful to mention is that there are only two types of required meetings (and you don't even have to go to them) : Tactical and Governance meetings. &nbsp;For new people I find that can make things more approachable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Matt,<br /><br />Most interesting question… Usually the challenge rather is «&nbsp;Tell me about Holacracy in 5 minutes&nbsp;»&nbsp; or in a few words pitch.<br /><br />30 mn is an intermediate format ; too long for a pitch… and too short for a conference (45 to 60 minutes). As speaking about Holacracy to candides may be a equilibrium exercise - the more you talk, the less new people understand - I would take 5 minutes to present Holacracy through a few key points. Speaking about Gov and Tac meeting is a pretty good idea. And then I’ld ask about any questions ;-)<br /><br />As people like talking, let’s them talk. About his/her job, the company, the tensions he/her senses, the big issue of the company from his/her perspective… The main idea is to make her/him trying Holacracy, instead of speaking about it. Like soccer : just kick in the ball.<br /><br />Hope that helps.</p>      </div>
