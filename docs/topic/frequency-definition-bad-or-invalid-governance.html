      <h4>Frequency definition - Bad or Invalid Governance?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I just received a question from a facilitator. They had a proposal in which they wanted to specify the frequency of an accountability, in this case&nbsp;conducting a performance review ("three times a year"). They didn't process it, because the facilitator had doubts and wanted to check back with a coach first.</p><p>My (and his)&nbsp;question is, whether this already qualifies as "specific operational decision", hence NVGO?</p><p>My first hunch was that it might be not invalid, merely "bad" governance.&nbsp;</p><p>If the accountability reads "<em>conducting performance reviews three times a year"</em> it would still be valid accounting to say <em>"yeah, I didn't energize that much - I managed to do it only once."&nbsp;</em>While the accountability is somewhat 'predicty', trying to pre-prioritize a future workflow, in practice it might not really be a problem. <em>A lot</em> of accountabilities don't get energized - so why not triple it? 3 x 0 still equals 0. (;-)</p><p>My advice was to test the proposal itself and become curious. "Why is it necessary to specify that frequency? Why not leave it unspecified instead? What is an example of a real tension that would have been resolved or reduced by specifying the frequency of the accountability?"</p><p>If the proposer can present a convincing argument for why not specifying the frequency would cause harm, then so be it. Specify it. If not - good. Get rid of the frequency.&nbsp;</p><p>That was my first shot. Can somebody enlighten me? <strong>How do you guys deal with attempts of specifying frequency?</strong> Is it plain NVGO? Somehow reading the constitution didn't really answer it for me clearly...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>
