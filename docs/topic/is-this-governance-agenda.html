<p>[@mention:457575321027129860], thanks for your input. It makes sense to have the autocracy of the domain as long as its not creating an expectation on any other role. I guess its about riding a ferari and waiting for the objection, if it crops up in some other role and not seeking permission in the relevant domain of that role by the role filler. Am i getting you right?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
