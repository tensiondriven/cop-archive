  <dd>we have a compensation designer role with this purpose and accountabilities - https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/11188478 If i in that role bring a compensation policy which also needs inputs from other roles, then do i need to bring it to governance? I am sensing that as long as I am not bringing any impact of my action or an expectation from any role i dont need to bring it to governace and just share the decsion on compensation as an action. any suggestions or how people have their...</dd>

<p>[@mention:457575321027129860], thanks for your input. It makes sense to have the autocracy of the domain as long as its not creating an expectation on any other role. I guess its about riding a ferari and waiting for the objection, if it crops up in some other role and not seeking permission in the relevant domain of that role by the role filler. Am i getting you right?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Shammi!</p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">shammi nanda posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>we have a compensation designer role with this purpose and accountabilities -&nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/11188478" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/11188478</a></p><p>If i in that role bring a compensation policy which also needs inputs from other roles, then do i need to bring it to governance?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>To bring in the Policy itself, the Role holder does not need to use the Governance process: they already have the relevant Domain to work with.</p><p>However, as long as the other Roles do not&nbsp;have Accountabilities to&nbsp;provide input on the Policy (or the process that the Policy specifies), the compensation designer&nbsp;cannot expect them to&nbsp;do this work.</p><p>Therefore it may be helpful to propose&nbsp;Governance that adds Accountabilities to the other Roles.</p>      </ul>
