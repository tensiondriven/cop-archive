<p>Hi Tony,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've tested it and it is a very nice tool for Holacracy.</p><p>Right now, there is a beta version you can test. It is as convenient as GlassFrog, more user focused but as Bernard Marie said, a couple of features are missing and should be added soon.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey Brian, that's cool - I'm looking forward to exploring these awesome new functionalities in the works - By the way, some of our clients are waiting on a french version of GlassFrog - For accelerating such now becoming indispensable feature, we've asked HolacracyOne for a quotation, &amp; are still waiting on!</p>      </ul>

<p>Sure, it's a software that aims to cover all features needed to practice Holacracy such as GlassFrog does? It has been developed by TalkSpirit, a start-up based in France that has implemented Holacracy coached by iGi Partners, two years ago. This software don't have yet the same level as GlassFrog - the gap should be covered soon.</p>      </ul>

<p>I really hope this contributes to the ecosystem. The recent change in the pricing model of Glassfrog is an intelligent move&nbsp;and sets the bar pretty high for new challengers. Once the basic features become "mineral water" &nbsp;the value&nbsp;added features will&nbsp;make the difference in the positioning of each offer, and this will be good for all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>The API strategy and the integration with third party tools may be a key differentiator (the APi strategy of Holaspirit&nbsp;has not been defined yet, at least this was the situation last week)</p><p>(Speaking of language: I too&nbsp;had&nbsp;enquired about the language localization of Glassfrog, and reverted to creating an&nbsp;addendum to the italian constitution that would help non english speakers get a hold of some concepts in the UI, I am still available to provide support to the translation in my locale if needed, maintaining a&nbsp;coherence with the concepts and terminology of the italian version of the constitution. I am 100% sure that the localization is a piece of cake "codewise", probably just the editing of a few "properties files")</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>Andrea</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>I've also volunteered to translate GF into Spanish. But I'm guessing it has been built mono-linguistically so doing the first translation may be a little traumatic as they will have to hard code every tiny piece of text into a string variable that looks for a separate language file. After they've done the first one, adding new languages will be a piece of cake.</p><p>I'm hoping now we have the constitution and the meeting cards translated into Spanish and other languages that H1 will look again at bumping language translations up the GF backlog priority list.</p><p>Ciao</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>Paul is right - it is more involved than dropping in the localization files for language support. I can see why you might expect otherwise, though. GlassFrog has grown and evolved alongside of Holacracy pretty much from the beginning.&nbsp;If you are familiar with Ruby on Rails, GlassFrog development started sometime in or before 2008 on Rails 2.0, which is before the drop-in localization support, and GlassFrog was never retrofitted. I think GlassFrog is actually older than HolacracyOne, but I don't remember for sure. I think they might have been programming it on punch cards or stone tablets.</p><p>In any case, as GlassFrog Product Manager, internationalization has been on my radar, and&nbsp;I was hoping to start spec'ing it out next year once we had this January release under our belts. But, as&nbsp;Tom Thomison likes to say "Reality will have its way with you", and I've actually been spec'ing it out most of today to try to determine how to&nbsp;fit in the development roadmap, and what sorts of things to consider.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Also, for anyone - we do keep track of what languages folks are requesting for GlassFrog, so if you have a particular language you'd pitch for, please feel free to reply and I'll take note. Thanks!</p>      </ul>

<p>What I find much more important than translating the glassfrog interface is to have an option to switch between languages of role descriptions (Name, Purpose, Domain, Accountability)! We are working in English and German at our company and are facing the problem that some Circles use German Role Descriptions and other Circles use English Role Descriptions.</p><p>Teaching English to all employees is not an option.</p><p>Essentially we need all roles in both languages but Glassfrog doesn't allow us to do that. All roles would get really messy if we just cramped both languages into one role description. A switch between languages would do wonders for us.</p><p>Big tension here! i suppose that other international companies are facing the same problem or will be facing the same problem. Please make such an option available as soon as possible.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Frederik, I was wondering if translation in GlassFrog should be allowed per person or just per organization, so it sounds like a yes to per person as well.</p><p>Andrea is right, it is even more complex and honestly something I had never considered. I can see that per person language choice + translation of core roles gets core roles covered, but I'm not sure how you would go about getting the translations of other roles in Holacracy. How do you go about making it proper governance? Would you propose both versions in one proposal, or propose translations, or something else? Or, maybe you haven't gotten to that point because GlassFrog doesn't support it!</p><p>In any case,&nbsp;I'll add it to the list to consider once we've got the basics&nbsp;of internationalization in place.</p>      </ul>

<p>Alexia, the Likewise Polity does not change anything substantial . . . that level of customization is what apps are for, right? As Holacracy embraces the call to outgrow HolacracyOne, these types of integrations ought to make more and more sense. I'm just happy to have access to the wisdom that practitioners are making available and wonder how that rare resource can be organized to the mutual benefit of all. Meantime, thank you for your faithful stewardship of Roles so near the beating heart of this transcendent upgrade.</p><p>Dr. K</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p><p>I've been thinking along similar lines:&nbsp;that&nbsp;the internationalization/translation work might allow GlassFrog to better support other versions and derivatives for the constitution, as long as the changes are only in the wording, and not in the functionality itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that pulling from the constitution itself could be tricky, but&nbsp;there might be some viable interim steps in there.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for sharing - I've been wondering how many orgs are using modified constitutions in those ways, and it helps me to hear about the use cases!</p>      </ul>

        <br/>
<p>Is there a way to map GlassFrog to the Constitution file so that management software pulls its display language from the Constitution file itself. If so, could we users then select which version of the Constitution for our context, allowing GF to remap to our language? This would address not only foreign language issues but corporate culture specifics, too.</p><p>For example, Likewise is an emerging college that has opted to modify the Constitution in two rudimentary ways: 1) we use the archaic academic title "Polity" instead of "Constitution" and 2) we use the more universal term "participants" instead of the ambiguous term "partners."&nbsp;These are small and rather insignificant details relevant to our context. However, I can see where mapping GlassFrog to the constitution in this fashion would allow for extremely rapid revision.</p><p>Personally, I love the user friendliness that GF has achieved and seeks to improve. Kudos and many thanks.</p>      </ul>
