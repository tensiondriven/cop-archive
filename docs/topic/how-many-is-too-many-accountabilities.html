      <h4>How Many is Too Many Accountabilities</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row">
We are a private school using glassfrog and a blend of sociocracy and holacracy as we transition away from a power over structure. We have a rich language for the role of a co-teacher which includes many accountabilites. How many is too many just in terms of usefulness? Would it be helpful for us to group accountabilites ie Interacting, x y z Planning, x y z, Scheduling, x y z?    </div>

<p>One big piece to get in Holacracy is to digest that accountabilities are not to describe a role but to define explicit expectations other roles can lean on...</p><p>The real answer to "how many" is very pragmatic - is somebody sensing a tension re that? &nbsp;It answer is no, it's not "too many". If answer is yes, then just process the tension - may be by reshaping the accountabilities into broader ones, or...</p><p>NB Curious to understand more what you mean when you say "using glassfrog and a blend of sociocracy and holacracy" as for me, knowing quite a lot re sociocracy, sociocracy and Holacracy, even if there are some similarities on the surface, are completly on two different planets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>To echo and add on to Bernard Marie's comment, I'd also say this: you only want enough accountabilities to address tensions that have arisen. &nbsp;You are never trying to "document a role" in Holacracy - you are letting tensions drive accountability clarity. When you first start with Holacracy, you want your roles to be super light-weight - just one purpose or one accountability is enough, and you don't want too much more than that. &nbsp;Then, let tensions drive more clarity over time.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Jenn,</p><p>In my understanding so far, I would say the right question here is not "how many is too many accountabilities", but "how many accountabilities the circle member(s) filling this role&nbsp;is(are) able to truly enact" ?</p><p>If people feel overwhelmed or lack clarity for traking tensions, projects and next-actions, then the role may be split either in Focus (multiple people filling the same role, each of them being&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;a clear focus) or the role may become itself a sub-circle of the current circle it belongs to.</p><p>Both cases may be treated&nbsp;in a Governance meeting of course.</p><p>In this last case, the sub-circle would split up in multiple roles as a self-organized entity, with its own governance meetings too.</p><p>Hope I'm right and it helps you.</p><p>Cheers.</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks Brian for highlighting that.&nbsp;Because of 4.1.5&nbsp;("Implicit Expectations Hold No Weight") it might seem that everything has to be explicit and by my experience the first target of those who start is deeply documenting&nbsp;Accountabilities. Easy to end up to a hyper documented bureaucratic governance. I think that the content of your comment should be added to the new version more clearly somehow. My 2 cents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
