  <dd>Taking consent on policies about your domain?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Section 1.4 of the constitution says, "Before a Policy is valid, you must first publish it in a forum convenient to all Partners who may be impacted.". Does publishing mean that once you publish u give some time for people to respond with objections, or what is the purpose behind this publishing? This is the section here - 1.4 You may also define “Policies” for your Domains, which are either grants of authority that allow others to control or cause a material impact within a Domain, or...</dd>

We don't just change the rules of the game without telling anyone.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Here's my interpretation: A role to which a domain has been granted has the right to define policies that regulate how it is impacted - even outside of Governance meetings. For those policies to have the intended effect they need to be published and visible. So unpublished policies are not valid until publication. You can't really expect others to honor them if they are unaware of them.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
