  <dd>Are the following statements true about Rep-link role?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I would like to make sure that I correctly interpreted the functions of the rep-link. 1. If a circle's member requests an action from a role that is in another circle (including in the super-circle), the rep-link comes to Tactical of this circle to process tension. 2. If a circle's member proposes to make changes in the role that is in another circle (including in the super circle) or change the policies of another circle, the rep-link comes to Governace of this circle to process tension. 3.</dd>
