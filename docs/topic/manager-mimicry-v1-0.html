<div>&nbsp;</div><div><h3>Summary</h3><p>This app defines a structure and set of rules to handle basic partnership functions for an Organization, in a way that mimics the talent management functions of a traditional management hierarchy.</p><h3>Design Notes</h3><ul><li>References to @SubCircle in this app should be replaced to refer to whatever role or sub-circle holds a relevant accountability for defining compensation, hiring, firing, and other peopleoriented systems for the organization. If no such role exists, create one when adopting this app.</li><li>The optional <strong>[bold clauses]</strong> enact a structure where each partner can have multiple Advocates; keep or remove these clauses as-desired.</li></ul><h3>Adoption Requirements</h3><ul><li>This app can be adopted as governance of whatever Circle controls the Domain of “Partner Relationships,” as defined in Constitution Section 5.2.5.</li><li>This app was designed for use with Holacracy v4.0; it may not be compatible with other versions.</li></ul><h2>Core Governance to Adopt App</h2><h4><strong>Add Role: Advocate</strong></h4><p>[Add relevant purpose &amp; accountabilities as-desired, and fill this role with all Advocates in the organization.]</p><h4><strong>Add Policy: Advocate Representation in Governance</strong></h4><p>Per the terms of <a href="http://holacracy.org/constitution#art232" target="_blank">Constitution §2.3.2</a>, only one representative of the Advocate role shall be invited to represent the role in the governance and tactical meetings of the circle. This representative shall be selected by the circle’s Lead Link.</p><h4><strong>Add Policy: Advocate Selection</strong></h4><p>Each Partner of the company may have one <strong>[or more]</strong> Advocates assigned to focus on them as a Partner. Upon the adoption of this policy, the initial Advocate for each Partner shall be the person designated as that employee’s manager prior to the adoption of the Holacracy Constitution. For Partners hired after the adoption of Holacracy, whoever initiated the Partner’s hiring shall be the Partner’s Advocate by default. A Partner may select a replacement Advocate <strong>[or add an additional Advocate]</strong> only with the agreement of the Partner’s current Advocate(s) and the proposed new Advocate.</p><p>[<em>If the circle that will hold the Advocate role is a sub-circle of the one adopting this app, then add the following clause:</em> @SubCircle may define one or more roles to hold the work required of an Advocate, and anyone accepting an appointment as an Advocate shall automatically be deemed to fill the relevant role specified by @SubCircle, and to enact its accountabilities focused on the target employee(s).]</p><h4><strong>Add Policy: Advocate Tiers</strong></h4><p>@SubCircle has the authority to define various levels or tiers in an Advocate hierarchy to further organize employees and Advocates, and initially these tier definitions and placements shall be whatever management level designations existed prior to the adoption of the Holacracy Constitution (e.g. “Manager”, “Senior Manager”, “Director”, etc.). To act as an Advocate for an employee, the Advocate must fall within a higher tier than the employee in the Advocate hierarchy, unless the employee is in the highest tier of the Advocate hierarchy, in which case the employee may select anyone as an Advocate.</p><p>Before a new employee joins the organization, an Advocate must be established for the employee, and the Advocate must designate a tier level for the new hire. An Advocate may also choose to promote an employee in the tier hierarchy. In either case, an Advocate may only place people into tiers below the Advocate’s own tier level. @SubCircle may create policies or processes to further constrain these initial placements and promotions. <strong>[If the employee has multiple Advocates, a majority of those eligible to place or promote the employee must vote in favor of the placement/promotion.]</strong></p><h4><strong>Add Policy: Compensation</strong></h4><p>Only the designated Advocate for an employee shall have the authority to specify and raise the salary granted to the employee, within allowed salary ranges for the employee’s tier level as defined by @SubCircle. <strong>[If the employee has multiple Advocates, a majority must vote in favor of any salary changes.]</strong> @SubCircle may create policies or processes to further constrain salary placement and raises.</p><h4><strong>Add Policy: Employment Termination</strong></h4><p>Only the designated Advocate for an employee shall have the authority to selectively terminate the employee’s employment relationship with the company, and only within any further policies or processes defined by @SubCircle. <strong>[If the employee has multiple Advocates, a majority must vote in favor of the termination.]</strong></p><p>However, @SubCircle may define general policies that automatically terminate employment upon certain conditions or events, e.g. if an employee fails to hold enough roles to o</p><h2>Optional Governance</h2><h4><strong>Add Policy: Lead Link May Not be Advocate for Circle Members</strong></h4><p>No Lead Link may act as Advocate to an employee who spends more than 50% of their time energizing roles of their circle, except temporarily to help the employee transition effectively to a new Advocate. <strong>[However, this rule shall not apply if the employee has at least two other Advocates in addition to the Lead Link acting as Advocate.]</strong></p></div><div>Link: <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/manager-mimicry-app/" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/<wbr />manager-mimicry-<span class="il">app</span>/</a></div>    </div>
