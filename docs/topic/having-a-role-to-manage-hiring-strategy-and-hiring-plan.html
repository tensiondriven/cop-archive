      <h4>Having a role to manage hiring strategy and hiring plan?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p><p>Does it make sense to create a role that manages hiring strategy and hiring plan for the whole company? Or this is by default GCC lead link's accountability?&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p><p>Xuan&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>As a nonprofit college our hiring considerations include the liability associated with hiring and firing. Our local laws make it best for us to recommend hiring and firing to the Board of Trustees. The Board cannot be sued for hiring and firing decisions. So, we have a faculty Circle that raises the tension of needing more faculty to the GCC lead link, who is technically the board's sole employee. The GCC lead link then relays The Faculty circle’s recommendation for hiring or firing to the board.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Agree that it is a good idea to have a role that manages hiring strategy and plan. &nbsp;</p><p>In practice, that role is easy to create. &nbsp;The harder question to consider "who has the final decision on hiring". &nbsp;Is it the hiring strategy role, a central Recruitment Decision Maker role, or the LL of each circle? &nbsp;Your choice depending on your company size and culture.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Xuan. I agree it won't conflict so is a good proposal.</p><p>If it helps, we are a small company and have the following roles for recruitment:</p><ol><li>Someone who decides <strong>what</strong> the future staffing /types of roles /levels /salary banding needs are (the CEO who has an overview of all Circles and the Company budget)</li><li>Someone who decides on <strong>how</strong> to attract and recruit people to the organisation (an HR professional) - which is the role you originally asked about</li><li>Someone who makes the actual hiring decision of <strong>who</strong> will be hired so long as it is in-line with the spec set out in role 1 above (the Circle LL).</li></ol><p>Good luck</p><p>Julia</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Xuan, not the GCC LL's Role. I suggest you create those "hiring" roles through due governance process.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:449833773917801859], if the need for hiring/firing has not been encoded in a Role, doesn't that undifferentiated responsibility remain with the circle lead link? It sounds to me like&nbsp;[@mention:500362325511060252]&nbsp;is dealing with a rather new company if it does not yet have roles for hiring/firing. It may even be that the GCC is still the only circle (i.e., an existing organization either does not it barely exists). I agree that the best solution is to craft those roles through governance soon.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:477139080146610445]&nbsp;Yes, you're right if there is no role for hiring "that undifferentiated responsibility remain with the circle lead link"</p>      </div>

<p>Thank you all for your feedback!&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, so far our CEO (GCC lead link) holds a role in determining if a&nbsp;contract should be renewed or not. Usually, he also approves new hiring plan. We are in the process of giving sub-circles more authority in terms of getting new resources. My worry is that sub-circles won't see the big picture, therefore, I think having one role define a hiring strategy and make decisions on which resources are needed would be the best option.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds like this doesn't conflict with GCC LL role's accountability. I will propose it in governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p><p>Xuan&nbsp;</p>      </div>
