      <h4>HolacracyOne Purpose</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Dear Community Members,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past couple of years, a whole lot has changed in Holacracy and HolacracyOne's world, and in the broader movement towards self-organizing, self-managing companies. &nbsp;Given all that evolution, I thought it was a good time to revisit our company's purpose in the world, to see if it too may have evolved - I suspect&nbsp;the greatest creative contribution we can offer the world today may be somewhat different now than it has been over our first 8 years, or at least somewhat deeper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To find out, many of HolacracyOne's partners will begin a purpose discovery process in about a week, under the guidance of purpose-discovery-wizard <a href="http://www.knowyourpurpose.com/" target="_blank">Tim Kelley</a>, who has a pretty cool methodology for this. &nbsp;Before we begin that process, I wanted to invite any input from our stakeholder community to seed our thinking. &nbsp;What do you see as HolacracyOne's deepest creative potential? &nbsp;What does the world need HolacracyOne to do and be? &nbsp;What does it need to express in the world, given it's unique identity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Appreciate any input (especially if comes before we start our process on Tuesday 10/27)...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>IMHO the purpose of H1 could be more concrete to reflect the facilitating + promoting nature of most of your work. Also, the current one (exquisite) could need another level of Why. What purpose does a better way of running organisations serve? Productivity, happiness, adaptability?</p>      </div>

<p><span>I think purpose of H1 is to steward the journey of Holacracy developing and manifesting its own purpose - Holacracy by itself has also a purpose which is different from H1's - such as parents have a different purpose than their children.</span></p>      </div>

<p>Brian, I love the existing one "Exquisite Organization" - I really do think it's appropriate with what I may observe as impacts on organizations implementing Holacracy, I sense no tension here, so I have no energy to try to find a new one. You could also take the "Teal Organization" from Frederic's book as I do think Holacracy is a perfect tool (and the only one I know) to transform any org. willing to do so, into a teal org.. Or "Evolutionary Organization"... or "Purpose driven Organization". May be Evolutionary Org. is the best fit in my mind today.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this helps...</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Brian,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I recently had to go through a process to identify this for my own, and those I help. Maybe these pointers will help:</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">PURPOSE (answers the question 'Why?') - THE REASON: guides everything.</span></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Collective Perspective:</span></p><div class="O1"><ol><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">What impact does the organisation/system wish to have on society?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">What is the aim of the organisation/system?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">What is the organisation/system called to accomplish?</span></li></ol><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Personal Perspective:</span></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">(you could use a Word Cloud to collate the answers from all internal and external partners to each of the below, to provide a picture)</span></p><ol><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Passion - What do I/we love? + What am I/are we good at?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Vocation -&nbsp;What am I/are we good at? + What does the world need?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Profession -&nbsp;What does the world need? + What does the world want?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Mission -&nbsp;What does the world want? +&nbsp;What do I/we love?</span></li></ol><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">At the intersection of the personal&nbsp;</span>perspective<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;you will find Purpose which in turn should be able to answer the collective perspective questions. Ultimately the individuals make up and inform the whole, and the whole transforms this into something much greater than the sum of it's parts.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">NOTE: with this ensure you know the ESSENCE/MEANING (which answers the question "Who?")&nbsp;of the Organisation/System. In other words have a thorough understanding of THE IDENTITY: is everything, of the Organisation/System and how they differ. For this too there is a collective and personal perspective.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">This process also lead to my decision to make the Personal Perspective E</span>xercise a permanent feature of the Induction Process, promoting the continual living evolution of the organisation's purpose.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this in some way helps.</p></div>      </div>
