  <dd>Adding "reviewed roles / accountabilities" to checklist?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I'm wondering if it's fair to add "Reviewed roles / accountabilities" as a checklist item. The idea is to help seed that ongoing behavior where it's lacking.</dd>

<p>Not only perfectly fine to do so, but also&nbsp;considered good coaching practice for starting Circles. It falls in the realm of helping people &nbsp;take responsibility in&nbsp;expressing their roles' purposes.</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>Andrea.</p>      </ul>

<p>I'll be honest - I'm still not clear on how checklist items get added or removed. On what grounds can I add something like this? Does it need to be a policy first? Once it's a policy, that makes perfect sense to me. Definitely proposing a similar policy in GCC btw (thx Margaux).</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's a good idea!</p><p>We have this one as a monthly checklist: “Do monthly review”.</p><p>A monthly review is for us to review roles, accountabilities and policies - we have a policy stating that each partner must do a monthly review with a process clearly defined. The purpose of this is to make sure the governance is always up to date and reflecting the reality, not being obsolete.</p><p>If you put it as a policy in a governance meeting of the broader circle or the HR circle, you can put it as a checklist item.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hello Fred,</p><p>If you want to define how “All Circle Members” checklist items are added/defined, you can do a policy sure, as it is by default not defined in the Constitution. What we have in iGi Partners&nbsp;for&nbsp;“All Circle Members” checklist items is&nbsp;:&nbsp;<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/5035" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/5035</a> Which basically says that all Lead Link can add “All Circle Members” checklist items for their circles, except Business Circle Lead Link, which can add global ones (visible in all the organization), it is part of the policy.</p><p>After, all roles can put checklists items, if in consciousness they estimate that important, to put visibility on, as we would pass on it in every Triage meetings.</p><p>For example, as @Save role, I have a checklist item “GoogleDrive and DropBox are saved” for example, we need to put visibility on, as we estimate that it is a very important action that need to be done. And if there is one time a “No check”, we have visibility on that, and maybe a tension from someone would merge and bring it to the agenda. That things wouldn't have been possible if there wasn't visibility on this action via Checklists items.</p><p>To come back to our policy, it also says that for example, you can ask to a role to put a checklist item to its role -except if he have an objection (valid reason why it would cause harm etc.)- in order to pass on it on every Triage meetings.</p><p>Have a nice day,</p>      </ul>

<p>You are right to be rigorous <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Section 4.1.1 Duty of Transparency</p><ul><li><strong>(d) Checklist Items &amp; Metrics:</strong> You must share whether you have completed any regular, recurring actions that you routinely perform in service your Roles in the Circle.

<p>Submitting two proposals for GCC thanks to&nbsp;this thread:</p><h4>Monthly Governance Review</h4><p>At least once per month, each circle member must review their roles and the policies that impact their roles using the questions below. If the answer to any of the questions is "no", then that circle member has a responsibility to address that through a proposal at the next governance meeting.</p><p>• Are the policies impacting my role clear and relevant?<br />• Does my role have a purpose? If there is a purpose, is it sufficiently clear and explicit?<br />• If I have a domain, is it still useful? Is it as clear and precise as it could be? Are the policies I've added to my domain as clear as they can be?<br />• Are my accountabilities necessary for the organization? As clear as they can be? Are they all recurring actions and not simply next-actions or projects?<br />• Are the expectations and boundaries between my role and other roles clear?</p><p>Additionally, every Circle must add a monthly checklist item of "Governance reviewed + proposals crafted per GCC policy" to "All Circle Members", which can be removed by any circle member as long as no other member wants to keep it. If removed, any circle member can re-add it at any time.</p><hr /><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>Adding / Removing Checklist Items</h4><p>Any circle member can add to the checklist a recurring action they perform in any of their roles within the Circle.</p><p>To add a checklist item for a role you do not hold, you must ask the role-filler for permission. They must grant it unless they believe that it would cause harm or move things backward, in which case they should explain as much to the requester.</p><p>To remove a checklist item, you must the ask the Circle during a tactical meeting. If any circle member present would like it to remain, then it should not be removed.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4>      </ul>

<p>Might using the phrase "your roles" lead to confusion? This phrase also appears in the constitution. It seems to me that the phrase "roles that you serve" or "the role you steward" is more respective of the organization.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>@Margaux: Not sure 4.1.1.d totally covers my policy proposal, specifically some details around requesting the addition of an item added for a role you don't hold, and especially the removal of a checklist item. I actually think this section of the Constitution could be much clearer.</p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Margaux posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>Section 4.1.1 Duty of Transparency</p><ul><li><strong>(d) Checklist Items &amp; Metrics:</strong> You must share whether you have completed any regular, recurring actions that you routinely perform in service your Roles in the Circle.

<p>@Fred, yeah I can see that challenge. The trick will be communicating the sense of ownership that comes with a healthy accountability without giving room for the unhealthy attitudes that lead to turf wars.</p>      </ul>
