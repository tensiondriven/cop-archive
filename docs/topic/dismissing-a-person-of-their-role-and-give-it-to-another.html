      <h4>Dismissing a person of their role and give it to another</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Does dismissing a person of their role and give it to another should be done in a governance meeting? or this has to be done outside the meeting?. I understand that no human issues should be discuss in a governance meeting and that is why I am doubting on this one.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to remove a role from your governance&nbsp;I am sure that this has to be done in the meetting&nbsp;but in this case we want to keep the role and only give it to another person.&nbsp;</p><p>My guess Is that since this is a Lead Link accountability he can do this outside a meeting if there is no policy stateting otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Can anybody help me on this one??</p><p>Thanks!!</p><p>SebastiÁn</p>    </div>

<p>my take (experts please jump in and correct me if needed) :</p><p>Constitution deals with the matter in a few spots (disclaimer : i am not using the complete wording)</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;3.1 : this article Does not list &nbsp;resource and partner allocation as valid governance</p><p>- &nbsp;Appendix A: Lead link assigns partners and resources</p><p>- &nbsp;2.2.3 : Lead link Accountabilities&nbsp;can be delegated to other roles or alternate means.</p><p>My conclusion is that you can delegate partner assignment to any separated process you may choose, but this has nothing to do with the governance meeting.</p><p>On a general basis it is my understanding that a separation of resource assignment from governance is the key to avoid proposals and objections to become polluted by resource availability issues. This is a very good thing to do because many ideas would otherwise be stopped by sentences such as "we don't have enough resources to do that --&gt; therefore this is not a good idea" .</p><p>in my experience this kind of objections &nbsp;very frequently hijacks&nbsp;&nbsp;good ideas in companies not practicing Holacracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Sebastian,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Role assignment= operations, outside of governance meetings, done by the Lead Link unless specified otherwise by policy</p><p>Definition and modification of roles= governance only</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that answers.</p>      </div>
