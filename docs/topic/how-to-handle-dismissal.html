  <dd>How to handle Dismissal</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hello everyone, In holacracy the way of firing people is often seen is something which is difficult. I've seen some apps for firing but most of them are related to performance management and require constant feedback. My question to you all: Are there any tools or apps that you use in your organization to make a dismissal-procedure operational? And how do you handle dismissal in holacracy in combination with the applicable national law? Kind regards, Dion</dd>

This is for me one of the greatest value backed in Holacracy is the need to distill into governance the way - which is so often unclear/unconscious - firing is decided.

I would say you've to find the balance between the regulatory constraints and what could be a more fair and dynamic way for firing. Anyway, when encoding the firing process, whatever App you come up with, should evolve the way firing is decided/done.</p>      </ul>
