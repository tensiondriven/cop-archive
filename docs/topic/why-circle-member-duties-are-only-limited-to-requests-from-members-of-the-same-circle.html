      <h4>Why circle member duties are only limited to requests from members of the same circle?</h4>

    <div class="Box-row">
Hi, all: I'm wondering why in the Holacracy Constitution V4.1, Section 4.1, duties of transparency, processing, and prioritization are only applicable for requests from other members of the same circle. Does it really mean that as a member of a particular circle, if a request comes in from a member of another circle, that I don't have the duty to be transparent, to process the request and to follow the prioritization order ?

<p>Turns out there was already a similar thread before:</p><p><a href="/topic/prioritisation-duties?reply=491495232306760447#491495232306760447" target="_blank">...7#491495232306760447</a></p><p>We're doing it as if the duties are company wide, as opposed to just within the same circle. &nbsp;I guess to make it formal, we need to create a policy at the board level to amend this clause. Can I or should I do that ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
