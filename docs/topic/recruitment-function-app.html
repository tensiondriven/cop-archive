<p>This actually came at a really good time for me as we are going through the recruiting process now. Our hiring process has left a lot to be desired in unclear delineation of who is accountable for what, who can make what decisions, and because that was unclear our process didn't go well.</p><p>I just proposed async that PurelyPoultry try out this app. Here we don't use the word CV, "adverts", manager, "to briefs",&nbsp;</p><p>We just removed CV so it is simply application. We used the full word for advertisement, we named the role Hiring instead of Hiring Manager. I honestly did not know exactly to fix "to briefs" in a way that made sense to me so I just proposed it because it is safe enough to try and we will revisit later.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided to not make it a circle, at least initially. We already have a People and Partnership circle and I am unsure if we need the new circle.&nbsp;</p><p>It is a really nice improvement to break out what we previously had on an unclear multi-filled role of what we called a Team Diplomat.</p><p>I hope that maybe we are able to come up with a clear system for firing or removing from partnership as well.</p>      </div>

<p>"Hiring Decision" could also be a good role name for people who don't want to use the word "manager" (although "Hiring Manager" is&nbsp;standard jargon in recruitment)</p>      </div>

<p>great app! one way on how to distribute this even more is create a policy that says something like this:</p><p>Hiring decisions:</p><p>@hiring_manager&nbsp;can only make a hiring decision in a dedicated meeting where the Hiring Manager makes a proposal to hire a candidate and role @self_management_fit_interviewer and @Role_Fit_Interviewer&nbsp;have no objections following the IDM process.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Really glad to hear this helped - makes it worthwhile having shared <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>We've certainly used some pretty generic business jargon in our governance and in this app - great that you've customised it.

<p>To fit with the pipeline stages that we have in our new Breezy HR system we used wording in the roles to be that Role Fit Interviews = phone screens and Self Management Fit Interviews = "interviews". We also split Application Reviewer as a separate role away from Recruiter. It seemed helpful that Recruiter would bring in the candidates and Application Reviewer actually says if they are good candidates or not and worthy of a Role fit Interview. Our HR System does all the communication with the candidates for us automatically once we set up the email templates for who is in what pipeline stage but we do still have a governance tension to figure out who should define what those "pipeline stages" are and what the template communications should be when candidates enter those stages.</p><p>Also just a tip, Calendly is totally free and removes a ton of the work of scheduling interviews and then you don't have to have a role accountable for it.</p>      </div>

<p>Oh yeah Calendly could be pretty cool for setting up initial phone calls - I'll take that suggestion to our Recruiter.&nbsp;</p><p>We can also expect&nbsp;application feedback from the Hiring Manager - and that works for us - but I can see&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate Application Reviewer&nbsp;role really teases apart some maybe conflicting motivations so it's a cool development of the app <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>      </div>
