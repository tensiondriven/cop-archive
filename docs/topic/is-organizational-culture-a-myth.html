      <h4>Is organizational culture a myth?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hey everybody, I'm curious about&nbsp;your thoughts on this article. &nbsp;<br /><br />Dr. Muff is making a distinction between organizations and groups of people. She seems to be claiming that culture has nothing to do with the organization, only the people.<br /><br />Is this true where you work?<a href="https://bsl-blog.org/2017/02/28/the-myth-of-organizational-culture/comment-page-1"><br /><br />https://bsl-blog.org/2017/02/2...lture/comment-page-1</a></p>    </div>

<p>Here's a part that stood out to me:</p><p>Personal relationships are apparent in every single moment that people work together – in the same space or around a common purpose; rather than being an occasional moment around the coffee machine, they dominate all interactions. Purely work-related decisions form the exception in such exchanges, something we have become able to distinguish thanks to Holacracy, which forces a particular and awkward talk-protocol when work is concerned. As such we would start work-talk with a sentence that sounds like, “In my role of ….., I would like to talk to you in your role of … about …”. And this is where the conversation shifts from a personal talk to a work-talk where the two people share specific accountabilities they can expect within their cooperation.</p><p>Such a situation is in stark contrast with the more typical situation where a person with a superior position casually strolls into an office of one of her or his subordinates, leans against the doorpost and in a collegial tone starts a friendly conversation that, depending on personal affinity, is either relaxed, hearty or a bit tense. Typically, somewhere towards the end of that nice chat, the boss comes up with some new expectation, deadline reminder, urgent action to be embraced or a long-term project to ponder. Depending on the managerial style of the supervisor, she or he either checks back about the feasibility of this requests or just strolls out of the office, fully expecting the subordinate to take her/his request as an order. <em><strong>This is a normal mix of personal and work relationship that all of us who work in a normal hierarchy are used to and know by experience in all of its wonderful – and less wonderful – shades of conscious or unconscious manipulation</strong></em>.</p>      </div>
