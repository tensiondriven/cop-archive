      <h4>Anchor Circle Redux</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>GlassFroggers -</p><p>Our nonprofit organization is hybrid Holacracy and will remain so for the forseeable future - an anchor circle running all operations and a board of directors using bylaws/Robert's Rules modified.</p><p>Our ratifier (then-Board Chair) did our initial GlassFrog setup, and set up the board as the anchor circle instead of our operations team as the anchor circle - which it clearly is identified as in all the documentation.</p><p>SO. &nbsp;What is the best way for me/us (I'm anchor circle secretary) to undo this and not lose all the other role definitions, sub-circles, projects etc etc?</p><p>The only thing I could think of was relocating the Roles in the 'true' anchor circle (lead operating circle) up to the board circle, editing the board circle to have all the same purpose/accountability/domain etc of the lead operating&nbsp;circle, then remove the lead operating circle's empty shell, and finally rename the board circle to lead operating circle.</p><p>A shell game, perhaps, and in many ways not especially urgent, but my eons-long term as anchor circle Secretary is coming to an end and I hvae a strong desire to leave an accurate record - one that reflects our true structure - before I go. &nbsp;Finally the structure and governance record in GlassFrog would be accurate, we wouldn't have a Rep Link to the board, but could elect a Cross link to the Board.</p><p>Darnit, I was probably too prosaic again. &nbsp;Call it a character default.</p>    </div>

<p>Hey Keith - I think if you hold a governance meeting in your board, remove your highest sub circle, and then retain as a role if needed, plus retain all the policies and roles, that basically re-creates the appropriate anchor circle.</p><p>You can rename Board and edit purpose, or whoever LL of Anchor circle is can do that.</p><p>Does it sound legit?</p>      </div>

<p>We did exactly that with&nbsp;Structure &amp; Process a while back, when we&nbsp;removed a "Board" Level that existed above the GCC: Governance Meeting of the Anchor Circle:&nbsp;Restructure the Sub-Circle, pulling up all roles and policies, remove the empty shell of the ex-lower-circle. Close the meeting, then rename and repurpose the Anchor Circle.</p><p>OK, you already had all of that, but it was nice to write it up in full again. :-)</p>      </div>

<p>So, this is interesting.</p><p>I am actually considering doing just the opposite here. We have a GCC with our company, but I want to create a Board&nbsp;circle that&nbsp;sets the&nbsp;vision and strategy for the GCC and also&nbsp;holds the&nbsp;GCC (LL, in particular) accountable to deliver on that vision and mission.&nbsp;This seems to be the way that Glassfrog is setup.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm curious why folks are going in the opposite direction ... is there something fundamentally flawed with this approach that I am not seeing?</p>      </div>

<p>Rick,</p><p>Anchor circle in Holacracy can be set up in two different ways, it depends on your company legal structure: 1- With a Lead Link ; 2- Without any Lead Link</p><p>You can see on article 5 of the constitution. I think it is more a legal issue than a preference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the way to create it on GF, &nbsp;we've just done it with a client yesterday:</p><p>1- Open a governance meeting of your GCC</p><p>2- Create a role called GCC with the purpose of your company and a clear domain&nbsp;</p><p>Select “Make this role a Circle” and inject all the roles and policies (unless you want to retain some roles/policies at the Board level)</p><p>ACCEPT PROPOSAL</p><p>3- Change the name of your “ex GCC” (Broader Circle) by clicking on the wheel beside the name. Call it “Board” and remove the Lead Link</p><p>4- Assign the Lead Link to the GCC&nbsp;in the Board Circle.</p>      </div>

<p>Keith, I am not sure if you will lose access to the the history of your current Anchor Circle; there is a chance&nbsp;it may not be accessible after this move.&nbsp;</p><p>I would write GlassFrog Customer Support if anything goes awry or now with that question if you haven't made the move yet!&nbsp;<a href="http://glassfrog.com/contact/" target="_blank">http://glassfrog.com/contact/</a></p>      </div>

<p>I'm about to do all this, folks - and am terrified that I will lose all the History in my 'true anchor circle/currently a subcircle' when I work all this through.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there a way to export/save all history, or would I have to rely on my email notifications as a backlog?</p>      </div>
