  <dd>I hear about a lot of people who want a place to practice Holacracy. If you are an independent practitioner or are working in an organization that does not (yet) run with Holacracy, and are looking for a place I am talking to you! If there is no better way to facilitate these connections, perhaps you can post here, and organizations like Springest and others who will let you build skills or participate somehow can also look here.</dd>

<p>Nice, Karilen! I would love to have a space to practice, especially in English. I have some experience, but only in Portuguese <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p>      </ul>

<p>Hello Hello.&nbsp;</p><p>I, too, am interested in practicing Holacracy and with various online meeting platforms this should not be too hard.&nbsp;</p><p>So let me know when a Holacracy practice meeting to simulate governance and tactical meetings will occur and I will make sure I will attend. This would most helpful in my preparation of my facilitator assessment test.</p>      </ul>
