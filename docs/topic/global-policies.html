      <h4>"Global" Policies</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Hey,</span></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Has anyone of you experiences with policies that are based on external prerequisites (e.g. external audits, quality certifications, kind of „behavioral guidelines“&nbsp;etc.) and need to be valid for the entire organisation? Anyone ideas on good governance for that without harming circle boundaries too much? Apart from breaking it into Acc for subcircles...</span></p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Happy to hear if anyone of you came across a similar question and if so, how you tackled it.</span></p><p>Thanks for a brief hint,</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also interested in this question. Here are some "global" policies from H1's glassfrog:</p><p><a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/1000" target="_blank">Policy: Advances for Membership Requirements</a></p><p><a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/2172" target="_blank">Policy: Password Requirements</a></p><p>And others in <a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/circles/25#_policies" target="_blank">H1 GCC policies</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The underlying questions for me is about the meaning of Policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"<em>You may also define&nbsp;<strong>“Policies”</strong>&nbsp;for your Domains, which are either grants of authority that allow others to control or cause a material impact within a Domain, or limits on how others may do so when otherwise authorized.</em>" -- <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/53f068b/Holacracy-Constitution.md#14-authority-over-domains" target="_blank">Constitution 1.4</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do they only regulate access to specific Domains?</p><p>Are they also a general dump for any other rule and guideline? Like "<em>Only the designated Advocate for an employee shall have the authority to specify and raise the salary granted to the employee [...]</em>" is an algorithmic way of defining domains. (from <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/manager-mimicry-app/" target="_blank">Manager Mimicry App</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can work hours, dress code, language use, behavior inside and outside the company all be regulated with policies or is there a limit?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have an issue at my company that people's initial idea to solve a tension is to create a new policy even if an Accountability, a Domain, or sometimes even a Project or Action would solve their tension. Maybe Policy is the gravitational pull for all Governance as it is the most flexible Governance tool available to solve tensions.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Maybe this resource will help clarify it a little. <a href="http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Policy">http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Policy</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to remember is that a Policy enacted on say the Anchor Circle would by necessity apply to the General Company Circle as the GCC,&nbsp;in the scope of the Anchor Circle, is one of it's roles (so that circle as a member role would have to abide by that policy). This would mean that the Policy would be defined on both the Anchor Circle, the GCC and inherited by&nbsp;any Sub-Circle there in by default (this is in some ways the reason to carefully consider the Organisations Anatomy/Structure).&nbsp;So essentially Policies have a cascading nature by default, you would need to stipulate specifically within the Policy Scope if it were to apply to the relevant Circle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only</span>.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi guys,</p><p>thanks for your thoughts, very helpful. I guess the best way forward I figured out is twofold: there are aspects of global policies that are more general expectations and seem to fit better in a membership agreement (or labour contract).&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from that I like the way of having a Domain on GCC level: "All Company property &amp; ordinary business affairs" which allows to limit or grant authority via policies as shown in H1 examples above.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p><p>I think you do not need a Domain like this, as it is already stated in the constitution Art 2.1.1:</p><p>"Further, each Circle may control its own functions and activities, as if a Domain of the Circle, for the purpose of defining Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles"</p><p>In my opinion this enables the GCC to create policies affecting all the activities of all Roles within the company.</p>      </div>
