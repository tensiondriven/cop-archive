<p>Data:&nbsp;</p><p>Partner A asked to impact my domain X in specific way Z that we have never done for specific reasons. I said no, but scheduled a meeting to discuss w key players.</p><p>I later discovered that someone has chosen to impact domain X in specific way Z. I asked the Circle who had done so. Partner A said they had done so using Individual Action.</p><p>Our next Tactical was a couple hours later - during the meeting in my role as (in-house, not licensed)&nbsp;Holacracy Coach I reminded via 'share information' about the specific requirements regarding conditions in which Individual Action is allowed, and the communication/restoration points afterwards.</p><p>I don't see a means in constitution to address what has occurred, or in much more general ways, to require partners to adhere to the constitution.</p><p>Process Breakdown doesn't seem to address any of this - only if either a Governance process fails (3.5.1) or behavior or output that conflict with rules <em>happens</em> to be noticed by a super-circle Facilitator.</p><p>So I, as a partner, am bound to process tensions - mine and yours - and so I have one here, regarding my colleague's choices and lack of compliance to the constitution.</p><p><strong>Confirm/Correct</strong> - the burden to address these issues is on me, assuming this colleague or someone else in the circle does not.&nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Thank you Brian. It's a struggle for practitioners who understand these responsibilities sometimes - because of course there is the same requirement on all the partners to confront violations of constitution.</p><p>When other partners fail to do so, or to fulfill the basic responsibilities of being a partner, Holacracy can be a lonely world.</p><p>Any ideas on how to address - are there any 'best practices' re: 'consequences for violating the constitution'?&nbsp; Short of terminating someone's partnership.</p><p>Re: your potential feature I think there is some merit to establishing some baseline mechanisms regarding noncompliance - whether one-time or pattern. And/or to broaden some of the potentialities around Process Breakdown.</p>      </div>

<p>Confirmed.&nbsp; I'd recommend getting clear on consequences for violating the constitution; and I suspect&nbsp;the answer needs to be that you or some process can and will terminate someone's partnership for repeated willful violations.</p><p>Also, I captured <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/issues/203" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this potential feature</a> for v5.0 to potentially address this issue; thoughts?</p>      </div>

<p>Aside from terminating partnership, I'd suggest a consequence with real impact/teeth - like lowering someone's pay, or something like that.&nbsp; Obviously be careful you're within your contract terms with the person, and any relevant laws.&nbsp; But honestly, if&nbsp;someone has a pattern of <em>willfully</em> ignoring the formal authority structure of the organization,&nbsp;termination is probably in order - just like you'd do in a management hierarchy if someone repeatedly and willfully ignored CEO mandates...</p>      </div>
