  <dd>I'm at a total loss as Facilitator what objections are valid during an integrative election process, or how to navigate that round. Can anyone give me some examples and/or guidance? Thank you everyone!</dd>

<p>We had to reprioritize the votes as our first choice nominated Lead link didn't want to do it due to time constraints and other commitments.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>There are very few objections that would actually be valid in my experience. Since as Facilitator, if one surfaces, you can simply remove that candidate, that is one way to handle it. In fact, I cant imagine a successful election objection unless a person who is nominated is objecting themselves or else someone else literally heard them say they would not do the role. Those are the most common, and they are not common.</p>      </ul>
