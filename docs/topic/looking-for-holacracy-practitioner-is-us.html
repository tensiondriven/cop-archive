  <dd>Looking for Holacracy Practitioner is US.</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Is there any more apart from these in US. Besides, any one practicing Holacracy is open to me spending time with them, please write to me at ahimsagram@gmail.com . I have been part of an organisation which was into sociocracy for one year and then we moved to Holacracy. You can see our site at www.ahimsagram.in our fb page at www.fb.com/ahimsagram . We are working on nonviolent communication(NVC) and wish to grow into an intentional community.</dd>
