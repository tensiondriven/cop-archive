  <dd>I spent this last week evaluating OmniFocus, Asana, Trello, Basecamp, the project tracking in Glassfrog and Holaspirit, and a few other things, and I've concluded that really none of these software are ideal for individual circle members to use for tracking Projects and Next-Actions. I want something that lets me tag projects and next-actions by Role, but prioritize them globally. And I want something that will allow other Circle members to view my list of things and be able to submit to me...</dd>
