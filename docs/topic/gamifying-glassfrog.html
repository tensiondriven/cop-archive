      <h4>Gamifying Glassfrog</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I just joined this forum today, and since I am ultra competitive- all I can think about&nbsp;is how I can elevate my community ranking. And I started thinking about how great this would be to help new organizations adopt Holacracy. &nbsp;I'm wondering if it's in the glassfrog product roadmap to have a gamification feature to drive adoption and engagement with new users?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, want to open this discussion to see if any organizations have been successful in using gamification in any other ways to drive Holacracy adoption/ engagement in their organizations? &nbsp;</p>    </div>

<p>Hi Leanne,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One way to add a gaming aspect to GF we are trying is setting up some achievements and giving each a point value. Each team member can earn all points so there is an aspect of competition as a group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of achievements might be raising/integrating objection, first time serving as secretary/facilitator, first reference to the Constitution during a meeting, and referring to a role rather than a person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am excited to apply these in my own practice and look forward to other ideas.</p>      </div>

<p>I promote the whole Holacracy implementation as a game just like the famous book the great game of business. I love the idea of gamifying Glassfrog though you have my vote on that. My only caution is it should probably be about using GF for tracking projects and reviewing roles using the my authorities etc I would caution using tensions as a way as it may lead to forced tension or made up one and they really need to be grounded in reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yes I'm getting a little competitive in this Hoop.la platform but probably just for now until the next skyrim add-on pack is released ;-)</p>      </div>

<p>I hadn't thought of a point system per se, but I like that idea. The thought I had, that might work for my company at least, is a sort of scavenger hunt type of thing. We are looking into doing badges to show progress in other aspects of the company, and once you finished the scavenger hunt, you would earn your GlassFrog badge. Will have to think of another game type thing for the constitution, but we'll cross that bridge later.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Great question... We set up metrics measuring the progress of each circle re self-sufficiency in Holacracy practice. These metrics are published transparently. What I have observed with some of our clients implementing Holacracy, is that this catalyse some fun &amp; emulation between the circles.&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Bernard,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Would you be willing to share the metrics you track I think they would be most valuable but understand if you can't.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore I have developed a parsing system that parses the outputs from tactical meetings this then records the work into our ticket management system that then can be used to generate metrics on work performed by roles etc this assist the LL and role fillers in generating statistics that help see what engagement looks like</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>@Stephan</p><p>We've just shared them at the Holacracy Summer University held in Paris this month with other coaches. The ones we've shared as real ones from clients so we cannot leave them. Let me take a an action to build a template from those without any name.</p><p>Love already your parsing system. We don't have this kind of tools so we calculate metrics manually which is weird. GlassFrog should allow some key metrics generation re Holacracy practice like statistics as - number of roles per circle, number of tensions processed in governance per circle, etc... These are in our experience very useful data to monitor the Holacracy implementation.</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>      </div>

<p>Greetings and hi everyone!</p><p>Reading this specific thread on gamifying glassfrog/Holacracy is especially inspiring to me.</p><p>The reason being, I’m currently doing my OCAD University MDes thesis project in their program “Digital Futures”. The combined objectives of the written thesis support paper and design output are to explore …</p><ul><li>How might the practice of Holacracy, its benefits and challenges, affect organizational structure in regards to governance and decision-making within the private sector?</li><li>Can role-play – an act that I believe to be inherently paralleled in the practice of Holacracy and in many role-playing games such as “Dungeons and Dragons v3.5” – aid in introducing Holacracy to newcomers?<br /><br /></li></ul><p>In essence, the “Holacracy as a Role-Playing Governance Game” thesis project – <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nshtav8uq0gb7g6/egillrunarvidarsson-research-proposal-3.0-v3-min.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">Dropbox&nbsp;link to more detailed proposal</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;is currently shaping up to be a multi-user web platform that introduces the framework and working principles of Holacracy through cooperative, participative play experience. Our cohort&nbsp;is&nbsp;currently in the constructivist, experimenting phase so while nothing is set in stone, the following is my&nbsp;action-plan for the moment.</p><p>Anytime and anywhere during the week-long OCAD graduation exhibit in April 2017, visitors can sign up to play using their own devices by initially choosing preset roles to steward in service of a collective purpose. Eventually, the participants themselves will push towards emergent, cooperative creation of additional roles and relevant artifacts. To turn visitors from spectators to participants, the output will reference the aesthetic setting of approaching an already in-play table-top board game by projecting the in-play participants’ progress and actions onto the top of a surface.&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8us4xc3sn8b9xw/egill-colloquium-poster.jpg?dl=0" target="_blank">Dropbox link to&nbsp;my proposal presentation “poster”</a>&nbsp;during the cohort’s colloquium last week).</p><p>I’m currently in ideation-mode regarding …</p><ul><li>setting up a fictional organization with a shared purpose and initial roles. As an example, if you’ve played the immensely fun, co-op board game “Pandemic: Legacy”, I could imagine an example of such an organization being <strong>Pandemic Curers</strong> (sic) with the collective purpose “To develop cures and preventing outbreaks of diseases” and the initial roles of <em>Medic</em>, <em>Researcher</em>, <em>Generalist</em>, <em>Dispatcher</em> and <em>Scientist</em>).<br />Regarding scope and number of individuals able to play, I’m unsure at this point. Blast Theory’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Gq1v7QgGU" target="_blank">“Day of the Figurines”</a> is really inspirational, somehow they have managed to run town simulations of up to 1,000 players.<br /><br /></li><li>In “Dungeons &amp; Dragons”, the <em>facilitator</em>&nbsp;role is held within the Dungeon Master who also plans adventures (narrative situations that can produce important tensions to process in Governance and Tactical meetings) for the players’ fantasy roles. However, in a Holacracy-run organization the tensions are rather created <em>by life</em>&nbsp;when doing operational work in various roles while the facilitator guides the meeting processes. In Brian’s excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQU9FcE2NI" target="_blank">“Holacracy: Governance Simulation”</a>, the tensions were, I believe, necessarily predetermined and handed to players beforehand rather than being sensed when doing operational work (of which there isn’t any). So I have to figure how to solve this tension-issue, which might be to create an operational game of sorts that allows tensions to be created via gameplay which then another aspect of the game allows players to process their tensions via the key Holacracy processes of Governance and Tactical Meetings.<br /><br /></li><li>Since I’m developing the multi-user introductory execution utilizing Holacracy’s framework in an academic environment as a volunteer, and combining it thematically with other role-playing dynamics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons, for example), I’m currently making sure with Rebecca Brover what I can develop using Holacracy’s framework and what I cannot. Under the <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/licensing" target="_blank">licensing subpage</a> on HolacracyOne.org, it states that “Anyone can freely use Holacracy in their organization. However if you would like to offer services to help other organizations adopt Holacracy, you will need to join one of our licensing programs.” This is where I get a bit confused for I am not specifically coaching any particular organization in Holacracy – only introducing its framework through public gameplay of sorts. Moreover, the same subpage states that as a practitioner (which I am, kind of, but more of a volunteer?) I can only deliver public presentations without simulation, which concerns me and is the reason I am seeking advice from the Holacracy community.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sorry that this post turned out to be a bit lengthy, I get easily carried away with Holacracy and Teal-way of thinking. I sincerely believe that scalable, transparent and participatory org systems such as Holacracy, which fundamentally and systematically integrates diverse perspectives and distributes authority in service of a transparent and shared purpose, will move organizations towards being more agile, inclusive and empathetic.</p><p>I’m thankful for any feedback, advice and concerns offered. : )</p><p>Cheers,<br />– Egill R</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:528792613988609658]!</p><p>Personally, I'm a fan of Holacracy, Pandemic, and D&amp;D, so that sounds cool to me! I think with a longer simulation, you can work in operational "work" of sorts so that tensions can arise - in the 5-day training, the simulation spans 2 or 3 days or something like that, so you probably have more opportunity in a longer game, or I would think it would work in a shorter game if you can give them things to do along with obstacles to that.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:449833773730792463], thanks for your quick reply and suggestions regarding incorporating some kind of simulation of operational “work” that can be distributed to relevant roles and make tensions surface – see how “Captain Sonar” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjo4iXyDPtw" target="_blank">does this quite effectively</a>, albeit in order to punish an opponent which is something I’d rather avoid. “Pandemic’s” focus on <em>the Other</em> being the obstacle of the game itself (curing diseases) is somewhat more peaceful, in my opinion.</p><p>Also,&nbsp;nice to see fellow Pandemic and D&amp;D fans!</p><p>Can I ask, regarding your 5-day training that includes 2 – 3 days of simulation, do I understand correctly&nbsp;that the signed-up organization’s representative (ratifier?) brings in her knowledge of her own organization – e.g., its current structure and known tensions – which&nbsp;is then used for the simulation?</p><p>When I was wrapping my head around Holacracy over the summer, for a class at school, I ran <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38TUH5bVNEM" target="_blank">a governance meeting elicitation exercise</a> for newcomers wherein they were initially given named roles with no explicit accountabilities, purpose or domains at a fictional tech company. During this first 30min phase they were tasked to come up with 2 – 3 emergent tech ideas for any kind of industry for which they would deliver a 5min pitch at a fictional tech-fair hoping to attract investors.</p><p>During phase 2 the members were told they had successfully attracted an interested investor who wants&nbsp;to do a bit of match-making before jumping on board. This investor asks the members of the tech organization to meet for 60mins to devise how they would do the phase 1 exercise again&nbsp;knowing some tensions that might have had surfaced earlier. They would be asked to utilize&nbsp;a specific meeting-process manual: Holacracy governance meeting process.</p><p>The members elected two of them for&nbsp;the additional roles of facilitator and secretary who held the manual and went through each step reading out loud each page similar to when people are learning a board game together. This was my main hypothesis: can the rules of Holacracy be learned this way or not? (spoiler alert: it cannot, unsurprisingly, really).</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of the insights I gained from observing and getting feedback:</p><p>1. Check-in Round: worked like a charm.</p><p>2. Administrative Concerns: no issues.</p><p>3. Agenda Building …</p><ul><li>Even though the manual given to them specifically states what a tension is in Holacracy terms, the member filling the participator role did not convey this particularly well so there were fuzzy distinctions of the term for each member. This proved to be pretty problematic, since the subsequent steps were skewed because of this main misunderstanding of tensions as opportunities for improvements.</li></ul><p>4. Integrative Decision-Making …</p><ul><li>Because members were collectively trying to understand and interpret the meeting process,&nbsp;where not even the facilitator was knowledgable beforehand, consensus and groupthink kept creeping in, for example making the proposer nervous of making proposals and trying to incorporate everyone’s Reactions in the Amend &amp; Clarify round.</li><li>Facilitator was not ruthless enough when&nbsp;protecting the process (presumably because he was not familiar enough with the process) which let consensus and fake-quarterbacking creep in.</li><li>At some point, I couldn’t help myself and butted in a bit reminding the facilitator and secretary of&nbsp;the valid outputs of the governance, and the empty list of Governance Records. There the lightbulb went off and members&nbsp;started creating and amending roles very quickly and efficiently – albeit out of process.<br /><br /></li></ul><p>5. Closing round: acted as a feedback session where participants shared their thoughts of the&nbsp;process in general.</p><p>Above notes confirmed some aspects, such&nbsp;as …</p><ul><li>the importance of the facilitator being knowledgable beforehand and not learning the rules at the same time of other participants. How, do you think, does that play out in a board game / simulation? Moreover,&nbsp;if the game is&nbsp;digital, is Holacracy’s framework and the&nbsp;facilitator written into the&nbsp;program itself instead of a player stewarding that role? See this <a href="https://kertavax.github.io/chat-holacracy-governance-meeting/index-raw.html" target="_blank">non-working prototype of such a chatbot-of-sorts</a> I created as an exercise (pardon the messy layout).</li><li>participants saw real learning potential in repeated sessions and wanted to process the leftover agenda items even though the time was up.</li><li>were frustrated with the slow pace of learning a meeting process where phase 1 somehow incorporated more of a “true”&nbsp;emergent behaviour.</li><li>Long-term processes vs short-term processes contrasts.<br /><br /></li></ul><p>I’ll be sharing my process as it comes a long when developing my project, specifically when&nbsp;figuring out context and opportunities for narrative interventions that enable&nbsp;tension-surfacing for the&nbsp;fictional organization (and hopefully overcoming my bias and assumptions that a simulation in&nbsp;a desk-job context would be too boring and not fantastical enough for user to engage in their own time).</p><p>Phew …&nbsp;[@mention:528792613988609658]&nbsp;a.k.a. “The Essay Writer” : O</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:528792613988609658],</p><p>In our public training, our simulation is all a fake org with fake roles and tensions. I don't have as much experience with the trainings, but Brian acts as the "world" which isn't a role per se, but more like the Dungeon Master. I think there's enough things that participants need to get done&nbsp;that tensions naturally arise from that, and I think that&nbsp;Brian throws other challenges/opportunities to the fake org (maybe sales opportunities or something), that add other tensions to arise.</p><p>Regarding the meeting exercise, I could imagine&nbsp;that it would be hard for a new Facilitator to stick to the rules and be "ruthless", since that is somewhat counter cultural. I could imagine a scenario where they were given a script that might help, and&nbsp;have the basic rules of facilitation spelled out beforehand in a clear way (e.g. crosstalk is never allowed and must be cut off immediately). I'm thinking of board games where there's effectively a role that guards something, like the banker in Monopoly or the person with the buzzer in Taboo. It is clear what your job is from the rules and that it is important to maintain those in gameplay no matter how silly it is to stand behind someone with a blue and pink buzzer. But, facilitation is complex enough that you might have to be able to play the game a few times to get the rules. Maybe there's a buildup/tutorial game you could play that would help introduce those rules, similar to the buildup of rules in Pandemic Legacy.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:449833773730792463],</p><p>those are great insights and observations, thanks! The idea of a guarding-a-process role is especially interesting, it kinda reminds me of a season 2 episode of “How I met your mother” (spoiler-free, no worries) where two characters, Marshall and Barney, engaged each other in a Slap-Bet while the character of Lily&nbsp;got the role of the&nbsp;<em>Slap-Bet Commissioner</em>:&nbsp;monitoring the bet and any updates or violations and&nbsp;issuing&nbsp;penalties for such events. Maybe a bit too much power for a commissioner, but a keeper-of-rules role nonetheless. Being Marshall’s spouse also created some interesting conflicts&nbsp;between that role of Lily and the one of Slap-Bet Commissioner.</p><p>I’m currently in a bit of a dilemma of either …</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>using an existing co-op style game as operational work to let tensions surface (including in-game narrative conflicts thrown the players’ way), and add to it Holacracy’s processes to solve the tensions; or …<br /><br /></li><li>creating from scratch&nbsp;a co-op operational work style game for tensions to surface (including in-game narrative conflicts thrown the players’ way) with Holacracy’s processes addressing the tensions<br /><br /></li></ol><p>I’m leaning towards the latter option for the former feels a bit shoehorn-y to me, and also a bit overwhelming in regards to the seemingly necessary task of upfronting all relevant functions, visual assets and elements which then might not be needed ultimately for the Holacracy RPG version of the game.</p>      </div>

<p>[@mention:528792613988609658]: I agree on option b - it seems easier to me as well to start from scratch. &nbsp;I suppose it might be easier to do option a if you have a game that is close to what you want and that you can basically destroy - write on, cut out or paint the unnecessary elements, &nbsp;etc. I guess with option a, I could see that previous familiarity with the original game being a positive or a negative.</p><p>Although, there are some pretty simple pencil and paper role playing systems&nbsp;out there that might have some of the mechanics you are looking for.

<p>[@mention:449833773730792463], great points – specifically this one: “there are some pretty simple pencil and paper role playing systems out there that might have some of the mechanics you are looking for,” since a Holacracy RPG game would definitely need the&nbsp;“Edit” option&nbsp;<em>a lot</em> rather than only rely on predetermined roles and their accountabilities throughout the game. Iterative design without an edit function is unable to work its magic.</p><p>I like the game mechanics of Pandemic (and Zombicide) which limits a player’s turn to …</p><ol><li>Using a total of 4 actions&nbsp;<em>from a pool of multiple options</em> which&nbsp;offers a bit more open-ended value to how the player decides to mix those actions together. That the player is encouraged to listen to other players’ advice but ultimately make the final decision is reminiscent of a Holacracy meeting process (nice, :fist-bump<img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /><br /><br /></li><li>Drawing two Player cards which could be resources (City cards as knowledge to be used for Discovering Cures) or a narrative event card (Epidemic = Stuff comes in)<br /><br /></li><li>Infecting Cities (narrative update =&nbsp;stuff comes in)<br /><br /></li></ol><p>So, essentially, I’m looking at various fake org ideas that might have multiple relevant actions to choose from that sum up to a total of 4 actions, for example. At a, say,&nbsp;Publishing Firm the actions might be to&nbsp;<em>Review Authors</em>,&nbsp;<em>Approve Work</em>,&nbsp;<em>Promote Work</em> and more actions that might need to be a bit more hi-level and not too granular, while narrative-inducing events (stuff comes in) might be disruptions to the publishing market, and maybe introduce D&amp;D-chance die throws to cross-valuate whether a published work was a hit or not (based on chance <em>and</em> skill level of that particular role).&nbsp;</p><p>On that note, I’m also wondering a suitable&nbsp;<em>end</em> for the experience&nbsp;since, as you probably know, the end of a D&amp;D game is almost non-existent due to repeated game sessions and character development. It’s the classical destination-vs-journey debate, but an idea would be to limit the initial session to an objective / mission.</p><p>Thanks again for your ideas and inputs,&nbsp;[@mention:449833773730792463]!</p>      </div>

<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>An update:<br />I’ve just completed a final hand-in of my MDes thesis document called “Learning Holacracy Fundamentals Through Play.” The paper documents a year-long design process that explored what&nbsp;Holacracy elements might&nbsp;be extracted and refitted for an introductory board game. The final (v.3.0) design output accompanying the thesis document culminated in&nbsp;“Little Bookcase Publications” – a co-operative board game for up to four players that introduces fundamentals of&nbsp;Holacracy.</p><p>Pasted below is the thesis abstract.</p><p>For those interested in&nbsp;learning more about the&nbsp;game and potentially wanting to further develop future versions&nbsp;with me, you can grab overview information&nbsp;along with a motion graphics video explaining the core mechanics of the game at:<br /><a href="http://www.egillrunar.com/little-bookcase-publications/" target="_blank">http://www.egillrunar.com/litt...okcase-publications/</a><br /><br />For those especially interested in the documentation of the process itself, the&nbsp;theoretical underpinnings behind the process and the overall motivation of creating the game,&nbsp;the following&nbsp;link takes you straight to the university’s repository:<br /><a href="http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1623/1/Vidarsson_Egill_2017_MDes_DigitalFutures_LearningHolacracyThroughPlay.pdf" target="_blank">http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/i...cracyThroughPlay.pdf</a></p><p>Thanks again to coaches and fellow attendees at the Holacracy Practitioner Training last year for their very helpful feedback on v.1.0. Sorry for the blurring of faces – you needed to be anonymised, according to the university. You know who you are <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>And further thanks to&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:449833773730792463]&nbsp;for play-testing v.2.0 of the game early this year.</p><p>Looking forward to hear your thoughts and ideas for further work on an introductory co-op board game to Holacracy! <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>Ps. As the thesis document is around 150 pages, a “tl;dr” workaround might be to read the abstract and then the conclusion chapters in the thesis document.</p><p>Abstract:<br />“Little Bookcase Publications” is a four-player co-operative board game attempting to offer an experiential hands-on understanding of Holacracy fundamentals via contextualized simulation. Players act as partners at a small- scale publishing company and learn by role-playing Holacracy-inspired game- mechanics. In the literature review and primary qualitative data gathered via rapid ethnographic fieldwork it became apparent that organizations wanting to implement Holacracy can expect a steep, initial learning curve due to the rule- based – sometimes counter-intuitive – decision-making methods instilled in the method. Insights were gained from the field of organizational development, studies of role performance and play theory along with a design process which started as design-oriented research and then transitioned to research-oriented design. The final aim was to explore what fundamental processes and elements of Holacracy might be extracted to fit an introductory game to ease the learning of Holacracy.</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks all, for your encouraging responses!</p><p>Currently, the prototype is quite an elaborate set-up of board pieces laser-cut from baltic plywood and close to eighty die-cut cards with rounded corners. That is to say, the exhibition setup-version of v.3.0 is not the easiest to mass-manufacture and distribute – at the moment.</p><p>My intent going forward is to team up, co-develop and distribute the game further with validation of inclusions made with certified Holacracy providers. In the meantime, the game’s elements might need to be put on US letter-sized / ISO A4 sheets for interested parties to print and cut out themselves. This might also help get more data on the game as it needs further play-testing.</p><p>[@mention:499799321313210508], [@mention:534281552617879089],&nbsp;[@mention:456167666726491228]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353]: is that something that you would be interested in?</p>      </div>

I know&nbsp;[@mention:452086181438015612]&nbsp;might be interested as well?</p><p>I believe I might be able to set up the game’s elements as printable&nbsp;PDF files over the weekend. I’ll get back to you.</p><p>Depending on various factors, there are a few things I’d like to address:</p><ul><li>As there are quite a lot of cards used in the game, I’ll attempt at laying them out with crop marks as economically and functionally as I can per page. Please be careful if you’re cutting them out by hand.</li><li>The v.3.0 of the game has coloured card design. Depending on your printing budgets, if you choose to print black and white, I’m not sure what effect it will have on the play experience.</li><li>The card designs are double-sided with specific backs connected to specific fronts.</li><li>You need to acquire one six-sided die.</li><li>Playing a board game with thin paper elements like tokens and boards instead of cardboard is likely to be a bit weird and flimsy.</li><li>Each of the&nbsp;two board elements – “Governance” and “Operations” – are larger than a US letter / ISO A4 sized papers. I might need to have them spread over two or three pages&nbsp;that&nbsp;can then be assembled together via&nbsp;duct tape.</li><li>As with many co-operative board games, in “Little Bookcase Publications” there currently are a number of Objective cards which set up each play session. I’d recommend the “Easy Start” tutorial which might take approximately 15 minutes to complete, however, the current time estimate presumes a little bit of players’ knowledge of the game beforehand. With that said, it will be very interesting to see how you fare by only using the materials that I have provided (i.e., thesis document, rulebook and video overview).</li><li>As the game is created using Holacracy as a framework to learn Holacracy fundamentals, I follow and use&nbsp;the same license as the constitution has&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/LICENSE.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0 license">Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0</a>).

<p>Cheers,&nbsp;[@mention:546244779278352720]!</p><p>I’d love to pick your brain, for sure, as I experimented with a lot of this tricky balance between how much to include of Holacracy and still keep to a fun and challenging game (without players getting too bogged down).</p><p>In regards to emergent play, as the Holacracy practice allows practitioners to be very creative around processing their tensions, there was further tricky balancing between&nbsp;“letting people create stuff by themselves” vs. “draw predetermined cards and make creative co-op solutions around these.” The last section in the&nbsp;<em>3. Methodology</em>&nbsp;chapter in the thesis document covers this process with tons of referrals for details in the appendices.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve got the chance, drop me your email and I’ll send you a Dropbox link with accompanying Typeform survey to gather&nbsp;play-testing feedback.</p>      </div>

<p>I, also, am a long time DnD/White Wolf RPG fan. I am looking to start an online RPG Game and Social Business Simulation using roleplaying and Holacracy.</p><p>As a way of working on my faciliator training to be prepared to take the assessment, I am working on (what I call) Level 0,1,2,3&nbsp; Game Simulation using Holacracy. (You can see what I mean by level 0 which borrows Konrad's Holacracy Simulation Game and I made a few adjustments.)</p><p><a href="https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/6818577/phase-number-1-and-number-2-vision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here is an overview of the RPG Gaming Idea.</a></p><p><a href="https://app.roll20.net/join/3301059/4d3yaQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">If you really want learn more join and explore the Maitreya RPG game.</a></p><p>Also, I am using Konrad's idea of a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/149WHSqE4qUbKQZ4oglowZlTKbgnN-vI-rwEZ-xbY_-A/edit#gid=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scheduling spreadsheet</a>&nbsp;(I hope he doesn't mind) when he did his simulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me know what you guys think.</p><p>Thanks!</p>      </div>
