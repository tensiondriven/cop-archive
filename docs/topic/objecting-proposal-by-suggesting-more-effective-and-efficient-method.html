      <h4>Objecting proposal by suggesting more "effective and efficient" method</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi all,</p><p>During our first governance meeting, one of our role present a proposal to create a role whose accountability is to broadcast new product feature to the company. The role will broadcast via mass email. Then there is an objection that the role should not broadcast via email, rather to use slack instead.</p><p>So my question is,</p><p>- is this a valid objection? the argument was, if things not done efficiently, it may disrupt other role doing their job as the filler spent more time on this and the rest of his /her role would receive less.</p><p>But if it's a valid objection, I am afraid that discussion become very long as everyone has their own opinion on how to do things more effective / efficiently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you</p>    </div>
