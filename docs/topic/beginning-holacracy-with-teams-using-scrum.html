  <dd>Beginning holacracy with teams using scrum</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Suppose I have a small software development department with 30 people with about 3 scrum teams, and a leadership team . How would they begin using holacracy? What would an initial constitution be like? I think a scrum team would make a circle. How would scrum roles map initially to circle roles. I know that roles, and accountabilities will evolve, but how would they look like initially using holacracy speak? Thanks!</dd>
