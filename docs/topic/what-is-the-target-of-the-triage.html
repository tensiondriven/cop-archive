  <dd>what is the target of the triage ?</dd>

  <dd>I think that: the triage is the moment when you find a role that has the authority to process the request to solve a problem (tension)... I mean that if you know what you need, if you know that the tension is about your role and you know the role that has the authority to solve the problem then you don't need the triage to solve the tension. what do you think about that ?
