  <dd>If I am "Rep Link" from Recruitment to it's super-circle, Internal Operations, on the "Your Profile" page this shows up as "Rep Link" listed under Internal Operations. This is confusing! Am I Rep Link OF Internal Operations? Or if not where am I Rep Link from? Would be great to get this fixed! Thanks, Andrew</dd>
