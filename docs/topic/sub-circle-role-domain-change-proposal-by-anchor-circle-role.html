      <h4>Sub-Circle Role Domain change proposal by Anchor Circle Role</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Folks -&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to wrap my head around something coming in Governance. &nbsp;Situation - Anchor Circle Role "CS" wishes to alter/remove a Domain assignment in a sub-circle role "ER".</p><p>Is that something that is valid Governance? &nbsp;Or, would CS have to engage the ER role's Lead Link (PR) to seek to affect Governance at the sub-circle level?</p><p>I'm trying to set aside opinion - which I will share here, that the individual in CS is wishing to exert inappropriate control or influence on already-established authority that is very aligned with ER role purpose.</p><ol><li>Is this allowed - for any parent circle or anchor circle, to seek to intervene in another role's sub-circle?</li><li>If this is *not* allowed, where can I find supporting language?</li><li>Is this a pretty common thing - for humans both in and outside of Holacracy?</li></ol><p>The 80's song "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" is running in my head.</p><p>I know I have all sorts of opinions about what others should and shouldn't be doing, and the way they should and shouldn't be doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Is that a 'real' tension - and if so is it appropriate in Holacracy to pursue Governance to force others to get my permission or agreement on their areas of responsibility?</p><p>What about Objections, when this comes to Governance? &nbsp;Could the PR role, who is Lead Link of the ER role whose Domain is affected, could that role have valid objection - since ER would not be present? &nbsp;Or would that be 'trying to help another Role or Circle' and therefore invalid (testing objection question 4)</p><p>&lt;sigh&gt;</p>    </div>
