  <dd>METRICS REVIEW : What, how and why?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Dear All, I am new to Holacracy and Glassfrog as well. We are having tactical meetings every week. I am not sure what type of questions should be there in Metrics review. Also, what are the meaning of monthly and quarterly metrics, if we are having meetings every week. I am looking for support to understand this in a more better &amp; clear way. Would be great if you guys can share your metrics questions. How you are enjoying this step. Thanks :)</dd>
