  <dd>Hi, I'm currently looking for an opportunity to practice Holacracy 'in the real world'. I would like to join a Holacracy implementation (dutch, english) as from the beginning. Currently CHP and willing to grow to coach. If you see possibilities to fulfill this request, please reply. I'm living near Brussels in Belgium, but willing to travel, under certain conditions. Thanks. Linda</dd>
