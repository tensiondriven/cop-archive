      <h4>Inside Zappos</h4>

    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Very interesting read from someone working at Zappos.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/thanks-for-all-of-your-concern-but-f9c6a86bb332" target="_blank">https://blog.holacracy.org/tha...ern-but-f9c6a86bb332</a>&nbsp;</p><p>I recently met some folks that were part of the Zappos team and in the tester for Holacracy at Zappos and they all said the same thing that is written here. They also made me feel better about where my company is in our Holacracy journey. This has been going around at my job, so I thought I would pass it on to you, in case you hadn't seen it yet.</p>    </div>

<p><strong><span class="normal">Some passages that caught my eye:</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal"><span>"Holacracy itself is... a hierarchy of work and not people."</span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal">"As a&nbsp;<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.holacracy.org/glossary" rel="nofollow">facilitator</a>, I hear a lot of feedback from both sides <span class="smaller"><em>(regarding employees experience and affinity towards Holacracy)</em></span> and get to observe an array of scenarios play out... From these observations, I’d say that on a given day, 80% of these issues are people-based, not system-based; that is to say that Holacracy is being blamed in many scenarios where there is a communication/trust/relationship breakdown at fault or someone is misusing the system (whether by intent or not)."&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal">"In any management system throughout history there have always been people who politick, side-step accountability and bend the rules in their favor. Since this shift, it just seems like this behavior is being forced out of the shadows at a higher rate than before.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal">“...we see Holacracy as a step toward self-organization rather than an end-state.”</span></p><p><span class="normal">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="normal">“When you’re rooting for something to fail it’s easy to look for fallacies that support your viewpoint while looking at the past through rose-colored glasses. It’s a lot like breaking up with someone. There were probably a ton of rational reasons that the relationship needed to end, but that first time you felt loneliness set in, you romanticized the past and scrambled to convince yourself that it wasn’t&nbsp;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">that</em>&nbsp;bad. Frankly, I think a lot of us cling to our familiar discomforts rather than embracing the possibility of new ones purely out of a need for certainty.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal">"An unspoken tension exists across much of the company around the apparent disconnect between where Zappos has stated we are going (purpose-driven, not profit-driven) and where Amazon firmly stands (profit/growth-driven, not necessarily purpose-driven). This is probably the largest “risk” that I see with a transition such as this."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="normal">(author: Matt Dunsmoor)</span></p>      </div>
