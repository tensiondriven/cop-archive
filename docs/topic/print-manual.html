  <dd>Is there a simple way in GlassFrog to create a printed manual re. Roles (complete with a "updates since last printing")?&nbsp;</dd>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p><p>The closest thing is the print view on the person page: click on a person's name in GlassFrog to go to their roles page. There's a printer friendly button that will print the roles for that person and a date stamp. Is that what you had in mind?</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey, who am I to argue with reality?&nbsp;You might also be able to use the API&nbsp;if you have technical&nbsp;capacity in your organization - is that an option for you?</p><p>If you want to describe a bit about how these binders are used, I'll take notes as GlassFrog product manager and can noodle on it. I've heard others request a printable page of all of the roles on a circle with their accountabilities and domains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">Alexia,</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">That is a workable solution. It may not make sense in a digital age to print a Roles Manual. Still, some of us work with/in regulated industries that require binders upon binders of printed manuals...</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">-j</span></p>      </ul>

<p>I have also been working on something like this. I've been doing it the slow way of typing everything in GoogleDocs, but that's taking forever.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a few circles that pretty much never go on GlassFrog unless they're at a meeting. It has been requested to have a binder of all Circles, roles, accountabilities, etc. so that they could look at them when the need arises.</p><p>If there were a faster way to print, it would be awesome.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Oof! I'll&nbsp;make a note that you +1 that, Adrienne! Thanks!</p>      </ul>
