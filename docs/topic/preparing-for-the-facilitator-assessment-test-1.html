      <h4>Preparing for the facilitator assessment test.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>I wanted to resend this post because I need to make one clarificaiton. I am holding the facilitator assessment training sessions at 8PM EST. So, those who are in <strong>CET time</strong>, might have issues attending. Also, I do have a modified version of Tom Mulder's materials and would love to get together with a coach and others as we hold governance and tactical meetings and I do have a created fictional organization that we can use to practice. Holacracy is one of those things that you can't really know it until you practice it. Is there coaches and practitioners willing come together to help prepare for the facilitator assessment?&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to sign up, just email at <strong>ascendinside@gmail.com</strong>&nbsp;(with the subject line "Interested in Holacracy Practice"and I will send you email you the necessary information such as scheduling, sign up and log-in information, etc.</p><p>Look forward to practicing with you.&nbsp;</p>    </div>
