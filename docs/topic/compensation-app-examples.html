  <dd>Hi everyone! In a coach training someone mentioned a compensation app for Holacracy called "Stahrs". They said I can find it on google if I like. I tried and I couldn't :) The key idea in this app was that people would get a certain amount of stars, that they can give to other people, and then compensation is decided on that basis. Have anyone seen a system like that? Can you describe it in more details here, or provide some reference? What are other creative ideas for compensation systems?</dd>
