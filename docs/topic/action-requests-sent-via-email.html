  <dd>Hi. First post in a while. Kind-of need a refresher. My former manager, now circle lead link, asked me in an email to do something. There is no question that that something, which in this case will only take a couple of hours, fits an accountability of one of the roles assigned to me. My question is just this: Should I be asking this former-boss to make requests like this through the tactical meeting process, or is it okay for them to continue to send project/action requests via email?</dd>
