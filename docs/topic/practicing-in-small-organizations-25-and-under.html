  <dd>Practicing in Small Organizations (25 and Under)</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I think there are unique challenges and opportunities for small staff organizations and would like to start a forum specifically to share insights and successes. Is anyone else interested? Some of these challenges include financial constraints, role overload, founder bottleneck, etc... I have (totally off the top of my head) set the staff size at 25 but welcome participation from others with larger teams experiencing similar challenges. I look forward to a rich discussion among our community!</dd>
