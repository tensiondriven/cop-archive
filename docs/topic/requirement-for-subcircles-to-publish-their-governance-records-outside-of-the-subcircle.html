  <dd>Requirement for subcircles to publish their governance records outside of the subcircle?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>If a subcircle doesn't like Glassfrog and wants to use their own (internally maintained) record keeping system for their circle's governance records, are they within their rights to do so? If so, what are the requirements for publishing those governance records in an externally viewable manner? It seems like the constitution would suggest the answers are "Yes", and "None", but I am curious to get other people's take.</dd>
