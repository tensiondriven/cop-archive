  <dd>Standing during facilitating.</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Just want to hear the reason's for the facilitator to stand while facilitating. I do see it helps u connect with different people as the facilitator can move around and come in front to the person speaking. I am asking this as we do meetings sitting on the ground and if some one stands then the people in the circle have to look up all the time. I want to address the needs behind this strategy and find the best way of facilitation when people are sitting on the ground.</dd>
