<p>Thanks Chris! I think the "DIY Guide" could use being updated. I've talked to several companies that don't have the budget to hire a coach, but they're ready to start. They just don't know how; I get questions like "Where should we start?". Part of this is also getting to an initial circle structure — I think we would provide a lot of value by offering some guidelines around&nbsp;that activity.</p><p>Curious to hear what others think!</p>      </div>

<p>Yay Chris! This is a wonderful topic and purely based on my own experience, there is a true need for more DIY material. I think there are actually a ton of resources available with the items you listed, the blog posts and additional articles on the website but it might be nice to have them centralized on one landing page.</p><p>Here are some additional ideas:</p><ul><li>A DIY forum in the COP</li><li>All of the webinars available in one place organized into a "suggested watching order"</li><li>A webinar devoted to GlassFrog use and successful practices</li><li>Specific articles/webinars/blog posts/"top ten" lists with some dos and dont's for new Secretaries and Faciliatators&nbsp;</li><li>Some kind of gamification guide for both Holacracy and GlassFrog (there was a great thread on this a while ago -&nbsp;<a href="/topic/gamifying-glassfrog" target="_blank"><a href=".../gamifying-glassfrog" target="_blank">.../gamifying-glassfrog</a></a>)</li></ul><p>I look forward to thoughts and ideas from others!</p>      </div>

<p>Hey Chris,</p><p>thanks for your input about DIY-material. I'm working in a team where we&nbsp;are about to start using Holacracy. Since we&nbsp;will&nbsp;be the only team in our organisation running Holacracy so far, we've already been thinking about how we could offer&nbsp;some teasers if anyone&nbsp;wanted to see what Holacracy is about. One thing, for sure, could simply be to invite them to a meeting or just show them how we work. Another thing we've been thinking about, is running a simulation for them so they can get an experience&nbsp;of Holacracy with their own stuff and tensions. Actually, it is also part of our job to deliver such simulations, since we are running a "Team Lab" where teams can learn how to improve their collaboration and even experiment new ways of working.&nbsp;</p><p>Long story short: If there is some simulation-material you can provide, we would really appreciate that. :-)</p><p>Daniel</p>      </div>

<p>Ok,</p><p>maybe I am asking for too much of a creative effort here, and I don't even know if it would actually address our objectives, but in my dreams I'd love to see some sort of a &nbsp;simulated comparison between &nbsp;a standard way of conducting a meeting and the holacracy way starting from the same fictitious preconditions.</p><p>In such an example an hypothetical parallel meeting dealing with governance related issue could clearly underline the kinds of anti-patterns that Holacracy addressed&nbsp;by reducing the influence of personal opinion, biases and ego on the results of the meeting (also impacting speed)</p><p>One could also inject some nasty behavioral preconditions such as: mr A ates B because he was promoted last year, etc.</p><p>It's is a completely different kind of example (a meeting with a client) &nbsp;but when I watched this comedy sketch, which is obviously exagerated: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg</a></p><p>my memory went back to several antipatterns I had previously experienced... It's a good way to contextualize the starting point of something that needs to be fixed...</p>      </div>

<p>I'd just like to add my voice to the professionally acted video. I just watched a professionally acted video about Software Design at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.domainlanguage.com/elearn/" target="_blank">http://www.domainlanguage.com/elearn/</a> .&nbsp;Before watching the vids I was a bit suspicious that actors couldn't bring to reality the nature of designing software collaboratively. But I was impressed. For those in my team that have never participated in collaborative software design, seeing such role modelling is invaluable. It puts in concrete all the fluffy words I use to describe&nbsp;this activity.</p><p>In the same vein, watching a tactical/strategic meeting would add concreteness to the fluffy ideas in the heads of us who are starting this journey.&nbsp;</p><p>As a side note, modelling my organisation in GlassFrog really helped make concrete the ideas in the yellow book. In the same way, a vid would make concrete the meeting process.&nbsp;</p><p>+1</p><p>regards,<br />dk-</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Chris,</p><p>a video of&nbsp; an excellent Tactical Meeting and an excellent Governance Meeting would help a lot.

<p>It would be useful to have examples of tensions and how they got processed concretely.</p><p>I was just&nbsp;coaching one of our clients' tactical meetings, and someone asked how to process a specific tension about the need to harvest learning from the different consultants they have delivering work. I explained different pathways for that, then I gave the example of one of our roles at HolacracyOne, "<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/24825" target="_blank">Internal Learning</a>" that we created precisely for that reason.&nbsp;Chris, in that role, has asked from our coaches that they forward to him emails&nbsp;to clients where we coach on the rules of Holacracy, and he compiles them into a centralized document.&nbsp;</p><p>It was exactly what she was looking for, and that&nbsp;example was&nbsp;more useful to her&nbsp;than my general explanation. She now has&nbsp;a concrete next step to process her tension.</p><p>So I suggest developing a list of examples of tensions and how they got processed in real life situations -- maybe those that are common enough that&nbsp;workers from different industries can relate to.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi, Chris:</p><p>I think a simulation board game or something like that would be really helpful, something like the "Playing Lean" board game.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be more fun for the audience rather than trying to imagine things, and we can go over critical concepts through the simulated cases on the board game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>A high production value video of samples of a tactical meeting, governance meeting, that are probably very intentionally scripted.&nbsp;FREDERIK FLEISCHMANN had this spot on above.
