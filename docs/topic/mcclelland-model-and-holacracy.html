      <h4>McClelland model and Holacracy</h4>

<p>Dear all,</p><p>We are a team made up by management students from University of Padua, Italy.</p><p>We are doing a research about the Holacracy model, specifically focused on management of three different type of people, led by different needs (affiliation, power and achievement).</p><p>How can these kind of people coexist with Holacracy's values?</p><p>We hope in your help and kindness.</p><p>Fabrizio, Laura, Viola</p>    </div>

<p>Interesting! I would not use the term *management* here but rather explore how such platform create a space where different needs may be met, what are the limits/things to add in order for different type of people to feed their needs.</p><p>I you'd like, you contact me via private message so that we may schedule some time for a conversation on that subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Hi guys, &nbsp;Holacracy is not shaped around personal values or personal profiles, &nbsp;as Bernard-Marie and Jean-Michel pointed out. There are however specific values, rights and duties each member of an organization is bound to when applying Holacracy, and these &nbsp;may make specific type of personalities and personal goals more or less compatibile with the system (or they may even contribute &nbsp;to a reshape of an initial profile into a different one after applying &nbsp;the rules of holacracy for a while --&gt; producing the so called "mindshift" ). Is this the direction in which your study is going?&nbsp;</p><p>(have a look at Belbin team roles, for complementary&nbsp;ways of subdividing personal needs/profiles in teamwork)</p><p>PS: good to see an increase of academic interest &nbsp;in Italy, I believe you are in good company (I've heard a thesis on Holacracy from the Università del Piemonte Orientale is also undergoing finalization)</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Laura,</p><p>Interesting topic... knowing that Holacracy do not "manage" people! Holacracy is just a way to organize the work to be done. Then, people are free to enact their role just as they decide to do it.</p><p>Though, regarding their own "needs", people might be more or less comfortable when working in a company running Holacracy. Is that your research topic?</p><p>Regards.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Would your inquiry go into the direction to "earmark" roles according to certain personality types? I could personally well imagine to make soul-role fits successful if we start becoming sensitive to these dimension. Based on C.G. Jung's groundbreaking work one psychological types and Myers &amp; Briggs came up with their Type Indicator (MBTI, see: attitudes&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...riggs_Type_Indicator</a>). What do you think? Are there roles that match for example the EN(i)F(e)J type, which in Keirsey's language corresponds to the "teacher".</p><p>Looking forward to tune in more into the discussion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Max</p>      </div>

<p>HI [@mention:542726102746093394]&nbsp;there is no dependency of people from other people in Holacracy. This means that there is no specific skill to be developed, that would by required by&nbsp;any person to specifically deal with personality types of others in order to engage them on the personal level to get things done. &nbsp;That is because in Holacracy you interact by following practice that goes beyond the simplistic: bosses ask --&gt; people do, and not by asking favors or giving orders that require a comprehension of the&nbsp;psychological traits of you counterparts in order to be crafted appropriately and be effective. &nbsp;That said the Holacracy Constitution points out which duties, authorities and expectations each single Partner (holacracy definition of organization member) is subject to. By starting to read those you could get a some understanding of what's expected from a person on a daily basis, to be a good member of an organization running on Holacracy. That could be a starting point for your research.</p><p>I would look at articles:</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art121" target="_blank">1.2.1</a> to 1.2.5</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art13" target="_blank">1.3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art411" target="_blank">4.1.1</a> - 4.1.2 - 4.1.3</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art415" target="_blank">4.1.5</a></p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art43" target="_blank">4.3</a>&nbsp; (intro only) and 4.3.1</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>I would love to see people practices around Belbin type roles, talents, types, styles, etc. I think these practices could be helpful for Holacracy implementations, though care is needed to make sure explicit agreement is achieved to use them or else make sure there are no implicit expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Will individuals be expected to participate? Use them? Are they for those with role assigning authority? For self awareness? Relationship building? Finding work more in line with passions and talents? These are the questions that could help shape implementing some people support practices, as I call them.</p>      </div>

<p>Hi Laura,</p><p>If I understand your question&nbsp;its about&nbsp;how different personality types experience Holacracy. Especially the transition into Holacracy provides each individual with a personal journey. its not uncommon that you experience something very postive about Holacracy as well as something negative before you can combine these views.</p><p>For example an affiliation focused person might experience:</p><p>- <em>more affilitation</em> as by the roles you fill in the organization you can now much more relate to the organization's purpose as each role has a purpose as well that makes explicit how it contributes.</p><p>- <em>less affiliation</em> as suddenly there is less of a team definition and the meetings are first about the organization. and it might take some time before there is a real tribe space emerging.</p><p>In this way everybody has their own experience with the journey into the practice of Holacracy. Being clear on what the plus/minus for each personality type is could definitely create recognition and more consideration from everybody.</p>      </div>
