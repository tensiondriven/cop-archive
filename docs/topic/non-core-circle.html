<p>Since a Circle is technically a Role, can there be&nbsp;a Non-Core Circle?</p>    </div>

<p>Hey Melissa,</p><p>Are you asking with "non-core circle" if an entire circle can be excluded from the Supercircle's meeting processes?</p><p>- Gerald</p>      </div>

<p>I'd be curious to her H1's thought on this because it's unique, but here's my interpretation:</p><ol><li>You <strong>could</strong> exclude the Lead Link of the Sub-Circle by making them a minor Role [<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art233" target="_blank">Section 2.3.3</a>], but I personally see a lot of cons and no pros with doing this.<br /><ol><li>I would think this would be extremely unlikely, because if there's such a small amount of work coming from an entire Circle, why would it even need to be its own Circle?</li><li>This would also severely hinder the Super-Circle, because if the LL isn't there, you wouldn't have as much representation from or communication with that Sub-Circle.</li></ol></li><li>Even if you <em>did</em> exclude the Sub-Circle Lead Link, you couldn't exclude the Sub-Circle Rep Link because the Super-Circle LL doesn't have that authority. So, the LL of the Sub-Circle wouldn't be in the meetings, but the RL would.</li></ol>      </div>

<p>Yes. &nbsp;I believe I know the answer, but I&nbsp;thought I'd put it out there.</p>      </div>

<p>Thanks! &nbsp;This makes sense along my line of thinking. &nbsp;I was just curious to see what others thought.&nbsp;</p>      </div>
