  <dd>Hello, one of the roles I fill at AIMMS is the Holacracy Coach role to support AIMMSians in practicing Holacracy. I recently took the practitioner assessment, and there's one part that really got me confused. Can you expect that roles outside your circle will seriously consider any request you make for them to take on a Next-Action or a Project which expresses one of the Accountabilities? FEEDBACK on assesment: There is no duty of consideration for requests made to Roles outside the Circle...</dd>
