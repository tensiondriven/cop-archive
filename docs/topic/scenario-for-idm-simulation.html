  <dd>Scenario for IDM simulation</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi everyone I was asked to present on Holacracy at an HR business event. The time slot is very short, around 30 minutes. And ideally, they would like to have some interactive parts in it as well. I was thinking about a simulation of the IDM process with 1 or 2 simple scenarios. Have any of you just simulated the IDM process with some simple scenarios with complete novices? What was your experience? What scenarios did you use? Curious about your ideas and appreciative of any advice. Best, Patrick</dd>

<p>Thank you for your input, Bernard Marie and Brian. It is very short and definitely doesn't allow for the amount of&nbsp;framing necessary to guide novices through a simulation such as the one in a taster workshop. I was considering, if it could work to use a heavily scripted scenario, but without the required framing it really doesn't make any sense.</p><p>Appreciate your feedback! Thanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>Wow, this is a challenge... For me one hour is a minimum to get an experience of the process IDM (even with a simulation), presentation of key concepts of Holacracy excluded.</p>      </ul>

<p>90 minutes is my minimum, assuming little framing is needed (which is not the case with total novices). &nbsp;Patrick, I sure wouldn't try it...</p>      </ul>

<p>Patrick: &nbsp;In that case, consider using this Prezi we created instead to give a quick taste of it:</p><p><a href="https://prezi.com/ci5h63r3gkw_/holacracy-governance-meeting-process/" target="_blank">https://prezi.com/ci5h63r3gkw_...nce-meeting-process/</a></p>      </ul>

<p>Hello, Patrick!</p><p>We often give little tiny tasters about the IDM process by doing a quick role play with two presenters. The main thing is starting with a Proposal that others can definitely perceive some harm in so that they can see how the process makes sure no harm is caused while still solving the original problem. Here's a random example:</p><p>Person 1: "The dishes aren't getting done. I think we should hire a maid." <strong>[Present Proposal]</strong><br />Person 2: "How long have the dishes not been getting done? How much will a maid cost?" <strong>[Clarifying Questions]</strong><br />Person 1: "It's been a few weeks and it should only cost about $100 a month." <strong>[Clarifying Questions]</strong><br />Person 2: "I personally don't think it's a great idea. First, I want to apologize for not helping with the dishes. I thought you were taking care of them so I didn't worry about it. I can't afford $100 a month for a maid. Perhaps we can work together to figure out how to get the dishes done more often?" <strong>[Reaction Round]</strong><br />Person 1: "I thought it was you who was doing the dishes. You would only have to pay $50 - We'll split it. I think paying someone is easier than doing it ourselves anyway, so I'll still get the maid." <strong>[Amend and Clarify]</strong><br />Person 2: "I still can't afford the $50, so that's not an option for me. How about each of us just rinses off our own dishes and tosses them in the dishwasher right away. Whenever it's full, whoever filled it up will just start the washer." <strong>[Objection Round]</strong><br />Person 1: "I hate the idea of having to actually do dishes, but if you can't afford the maid I guess we can start trying to do that." <strong>[Integration]</strong></p><p>That was just an example, but doing something that seems much more negatively impacting as a Proposal helps get the point across better because the Objections seem more important and the end result after Integration is drastically different than the starting point.</p><p>Doing this sort of example lets people see that the process itself seems very simple and solution oriented and without all the lingo you wouldn't even notice it was some strict process. Doing a little explanation around this role play let's people understand the basics far more quickly.</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p>      </ul>

<p>Thank you for this example&nbsp;[@mention:451241754031062437], definitely a scenario that I can relate to ;-) It's a simple, everyday situation which everybody gets immediately and it nicely illustrates the different stages of IDM. Doing it as a role play between the presenters (or between the presenter and a person in-the-know) makes it fast and fail-safe while still illustrating the point.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
