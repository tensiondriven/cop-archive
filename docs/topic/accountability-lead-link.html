<p>Can anybody explain me what is meant with the LL's accountability: "Structuring the governance of the circle to express its purpose and enact its accountability. " I notice in myself that I make assumptions about this acc and that for me is a sign that I'm not sure about its meaning.</p><p>An example may help :-)</p>    </div>

The Lead Link has the "extra" job to make proposals that tend to the <em>entire</em> circle's purpose, e.g. to propose new roles to express the purpose of the circle better, or to make changes to several roles so that the circle functions better overall. I take it as a kind of "general" permission and encouragement to propose improvements, and to sense tensions in <em>all</em> areas of the circle's operations.</p>      </div>
