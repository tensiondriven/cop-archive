The Lead Link has the "extra" job to make proposals that tend to the <em>entire</em> circle's purpose, e.g. to propose new roles to express the purpose of the circle better, or to make changes to several roles so that the circle functions better overall. I take it as a kind of "general" permission and encouragement to propose improvements, and to sense tensions in <em>all</em> areas of the circle's operations.</p>      </ul>
