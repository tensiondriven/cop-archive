      <h4>Changes to Policy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Does a Lead Link have the ability to change or remove a Policy outside of a Governance Meeting? There is another Partner in the Role that the Policy impacts.</p><p>This is from 2.2.1</p><blockquote><p>...however, that such Lead Link shall not have the authority to define Policies outside the governance process of such Circle that limit the authority of such Circle’s Roles to impact such a Domain.</p></blockquote><p>It could be argued that removing the Policy doesn't limit their authority (in fact it could expand it) but I seems odd that a Lead Link could do this out of Governance.</p>    </div>

<p>It's definitely not intentional that a Lead Link can do that, but you're right, that does seem like a reasonable interpretation of that clause. &nbsp;I've <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/issues/81" target="_blank">captured&nbsp;this</a>&nbsp;as a bug to fix in the next version of the Constitution - nice catch!</p>      </div>

<p>It was brought to my attention that 2.2.1 is specific to "Holds Undifferentiated Functions", so if a Partner holds the role wouldn't make a difference.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>

<p>Ryan, you seem to be using an older version of the constitution (version 4.0?).&nbsp;In&nbsp;Version 4.1, section 2.2.1&nbsp;simply reads:</p><p><em>"Further, the Lead Link may not define Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles, except via the Governance Process of the Circle."</em></p><p>(Which, I think, still has the ambiguity that you found, but is slightly clearer to me in its meaning.)</p>      </div>
