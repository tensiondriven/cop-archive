  <dd>If the role filler is not in the governance meeting!</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>When taking a governance decision if a role filler is not there in the meeting and an agenda comes where we need to add an accountability to them, would that mean that the policy or accountability cant be modified or added? Or if its added and the person who is the role filler is not ok with the added accountability do they still have to fulfil the accountability. Any thoughts or what does the constitution says on this?</dd>
