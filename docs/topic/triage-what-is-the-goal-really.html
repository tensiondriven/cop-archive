  <dd>Triage - what is the goal really?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I still am not completely clear on this, please help. I read in the Merriam-Webster dictionary (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triage) the following definition related to work: "the assigning of priority order to projects on the basis of where funds and other resources can be best used, are most needed, or are most likely to achieve success" Now, in the tactical meeting we don't so much prioritize but rather try to get through all issues and tensions presented. My understanding of...</dd>

Since the Role has the authority to find a solution and make the call, it´s not part of the tactical meeting to&nbsp;<em>talk until we find the solution.</em></p><p>It doesn´t mean you can´t call for a meeting to discuss a subject. However, this won´t be a tactical meeting, and the best the peers can do is help you finding a solution, but you will be the one to make the call and take the responsibility.</p>      </ul>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"My understanding of the term triage in Holacracy is that no solutions are created in the tactical meeting but only decisions are made on what are the next steps (next action, project, wait for trigger, think about a tension)&nbsp;to be followed."</em></p><p>It depends what you mean with "solutions are created": In my experience, we do sometimes "create solutions" within Tactical Meetings! (Our team is relatively small though, and we take our time for Tacticals, so we have the space.)</p><p>However, more often, the Tactical is used to identify what exactly is stuck and who / what Roles are needed to continue working on the issue: They will then meet outside of the Tactical to get down&nbsp;with the work.</p><p>I quite enjoy this way of working, as it relieves the plenary meeting from detailed discussions that are&nbsp;not relevant to all.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>I've looked for a more relevant definition of Triage to help you (best what I could find:&nbsp;<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage" target="_blank"><a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage" target="_blank">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage</a></a>) but i think an exact definition is not going to give the answer.</p><p>I think triage in this context means: there is a tension, and you decide what needs to be done to reduces this: a next-action, a project or something else. Like with the patient (triage in medical terms), you assess what's needed and process the tension in the most suitable way. &nbsp;</p><p>So I think your understanding of the term triage is correct (for what it's worth as I'm not very experienced in Holacracy yet)</p><p>Joni</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>I thank <strong>each of you</strong> for the many answers and support you provided. I am now clear on the meaning of Triage.&nbsp;I have to say, the last answer from Bernard helped me most.</p><p>You (we) are a strong community!</p>      </ul>

<p>And, in my experience, if during the Checklist Review and the Metrics Review the answer you hear bring you a tension,&nbsp;&nbsp;add it when you're on built the agenda. This is something that often happens.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are 4 goals to the tactical meeting, all explained in the section 4.2.1 of the constitution:</p><h4>4.2.1 Focus &amp; Intent</h4><p>Tactical Meetings are for:</p><ul><li><strong>(a)</strong> sharing the completion status of recurring actions on checklists owned by the Circle’s Roles;</li><li><strong>(b)</strong> sharing regular metrics assigned to the Circle’s Roles to report;</li><li><strong>(c)</strong> sharing progress updates about Projects and other work owned by the Circle’s Roles; and</li><li><strong>(d)</strong> triaging Tensions limiting the Circle’s Roles into Next-Actions, Projects, or other outputs that help reduce those Tensions.</li></ul><h4>&nbsp;</h4><p>I would add an implicite one on top of that which is that the tactical meeting allows you to play with&nbsp;role-ationships. It puts lots of clarity on authorities and help identify any “racket hole” / missing part of the governance. Of course you do that on a day-to-day basis but with the tactical meeting, you are sure not to miss any governance/evolution opportunity for the organization.</p>      </ul>

<p>Hey Andrea, I suggest you have a look at the Triage process explained in the <a href="http://igipartners.com/en/read-holacracy-comic-book-free#page-126-127" target="_blank">Holacracy Comic Book chapter 4</a>&nbsp;Enjoy!</p>      </ul>
