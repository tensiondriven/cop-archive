Example: in the structure in a circle, a circle is responsible for counseling people (Care circle) and another is responsible for training professionals to counseling (Dissemination circle). Some teams at the same time, counseling people and train professionals to counseling. In what circle should we allocate such a team? One idea would be to allocate the team in one of the two circles and having a cross link to represent the other circle. Is this the better way? Thanks in advance.</p></div><p>Have you considered a cross link?</p>      </ul>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p><p>Several clues to get your answer :</p><p>- To set the initial structure, just use Holacarcy to enlight and modelise your existing organization. Don't change anything during this initial step.</p><p>- Look at the coupling beetwen Care circle and Dissemination circle. High coupling means that the 2 circles are only one actually.</p><p>- Start as you want and rise your tension in a super circle Gov meeting ;-)<br />Hope taht helps,</p>      </ul>

<p>Dear Carlos,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From what I read, it looks like you confuse two things: people and the organization.</p><p>When you talk about team, what are you referring to? In Holacracy, we don't use that word, we have circles (organization's organs with roles inside) and people energizing roles within the organization.</p><p>We separate in two spaces: defining the authorities, roles needed by the organization (governance) and assigning people to roles (operations).</p><p>We no longer work in “departments” where a team only belongs somewhere. A person can now be assigned to multiple roles across multiple circles, no silos here.</p><p>So if your structure is composed of 2 circles with roles inside, them a person could fill roles within the two circles, no problem with that.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating a cross link wouldn't be appropriate in this situation.</p><p>It is up to the Lead Link of each circle to assign people to roles whereas it is in the governance space of each circle where we define roles (with the Integrative Decision Making process).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Margaux</p>      </ul>

Hi, Carlos:<br /><br />If I understand correctly, in the old structure, you have a team that serve two purposes at the same time: care and dissemination.<br />You'd like to convert this team to circles.<br /><br />Why not just create one circle with the purpose of care and dissemination for starter and have all members of the old team join this one circle ? <br /><br />Regarda,<br /><br />Dien.      </ul>
