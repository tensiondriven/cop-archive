  <dd>Changing Holacracy® Objection Test Question #3 - Looking for Experimenters!</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hey all, I have a change for the backside (objection-test) of the governance card I want to throw out to the community because, while I think the change makes sense, I don't have many opportunities to test it myself. So, I wanted to share the change here and see if anyone would be willing to experiment with it. Specifically, I want to change the current version of test question #3 from this: Do you know this impact will occur...OR...are you anticipating the impact will likely occur? To this:...</dd>

<p>Hi Chris, like the focus on the harm. Question: why do you choose to keep "<strong>issue</strong>" in the first part instead of "<strong>harm</strong>"? Why not:&nbsp; <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #273c33; font-family: Open Sans,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 25.6px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">Would the proposal necessarily create the harm if adopted…OR...are you anticipating the harm could happen?</span> This way all in the question is focused on the harm and by that resonates with the question: Do you see any reason why adopting this proposal causes harm or moves us backwards.</p><p>Will start to test the question. Keep you posted.</p>      </ul>

<p>[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;Good catch! I actually did change it to "harm," on the card but mistakenly wrote, "issue" when I was rewriting it for this post. The intended version will say, " Would you proposal necessarily cause <strong>the harm</strong> if adopted....or..." : ) I'll try to edit the OP.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>I like seeing the constant updates,&nbsp;[@mention:455886150941203371]!</p><p>I'm sure this verbiage wouldn't work well officially on the card/constitution, but I personally just go with something akin to, "Do you <strong>know</strong> [objection] will happen?" It's more personalized and easily comprehended, and their answer/explanation always reveals if it's a harmless assumption or a viable risk.</p>      </ul>
