  <dd>What are resources versus Domain?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>The Lead Link definition in Appendix A gives the following accountability: "Allocating the Circle's resources across its various Projects and/or Roles" We are playing with the idea of how best to govern company available office space occupation by different circles / roles / teams / partners. If office space and its use is treated as a domain, GCC may govern that it is assigned to a sub-circle that can then make an appropriate policy about it. The LL can however argue that this conflicts...</dd>

<p>Wayne,</p><p>Great question. &nbsp;I will take a stab at a possible tension around office space might be resolved.</p><p>Tension: People keep moving around and Facilities Caretaker (Role) has no idea when groups/people move from one area to the next.</p><p>A possible way to resolve in&nbsp;Governance.</p><p>Propose that the Domain (think office space or facilities) of Office Layout be defined for/granted to the Facilities&nbsp;Caretaker Role or Facilities Circle (if there were one). &nbsp;The Role or Circle would then have authority to create a Policy that let&nbsp;the rest of the organization know how they could or could not impact the Domain.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Policy: Office moves</p><p>Any team member may move to any open office space, so long as they get prior approval from @Facilities Caretaker.</p><p>This example is&nbsp;by no means a perfect proposal, but I hope it helps you process your tension.</p><p>- Dennis</p>      </ul>

<p>RESOURCES vs. DOMAINS - for me the difference is still vague, even after reading all discussions tagged with "resource" on the forum:<br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3yaTm" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3yaTm</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2oxQ7Ob" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2oxQ7Ob</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3GDpH" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3GDpH</a><br />- <a href="http://bit.ly/2o3ERVA" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/2o3ERVA</a></p><p><br />So, can anyone specifically answer the following questions:<br /><strong>1. What is the relation between resources and domains?</strong> (are the same?, are different and if so, how to clearly differentiate them? Maybe resources&gt;domains or maybe otherwise?)<br /><strong>2. What are examples of resources LeadLink can independently allocate? If possible, please name 10 examples of such resources</strong> (e.g. time, money – or maybe they are already wrong?)</p>      </ul>
