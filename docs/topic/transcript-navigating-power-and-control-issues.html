    <div class="Box-row post-content">
<p>Hi folks, I recently did this transcript for myself but I want to share it with the broader community here. Enjoy!</p><p>- Dennis</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>KEY TOPICS:</p><ul><li><i>To what extent can you prevent these issues from the start?</i></li><li>Preparing people up front, coaching relationship with clients</li><li>Authority comes from governance</li><li>As lead link I don’t have the authority to autocratically make any decision, but I have to honor governance</li><li>It just doesn’t sink in – on both sides</li><li>Accountability is accompanied by the authority to execute it</li><li>Habit of checking in with the traditional authority before executing</li><li>Power doesn’t rest with titles or positions</li><li>It is messing with people’s identifications</li><li>A pointing-out instruction from the beginning of implementation for the leaders</li><li>Active approach of preparing people up-front</li><li>Talking about ego, laying out a mental model up front, can help</li><li>We’re going to run into this no matter what – it will surface</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: italic;">Question: How to cope with these issues, what helps?</p><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Ask: Are we making progress for the organization with Holacracy?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Are we still delivering as we promise?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">If yes, what is this tension of yours about?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The organization is being held by the process just fine. So it’s not about the organization, it’s about you. So let’s look at these fears and work through it.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">How can we help you understand that things are safe in this new system?</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">You have&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">more</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;control to help the organization fulfill its aim because it doesn’t rely&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">only on you</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;for everything. The system is holding so much more complexity than it was able to hold before.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Nothing is out of control,&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">more</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;control is being nurtured.</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Aim: help the organization respond more&nbsp;<i>organizationally</i>&nbsp;instead of responding individually, more heroically, more personally</b></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Baking in really good business fundamentals</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Implementation will trigger a lot of experiences, some are more personal, but this is exactly what we want</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">As a leader those make me nervous, until I see that. I don’t just want to surrender to the system until I trust the system. Holding up that mirror and helping people see it for themselves.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">This tension is actually about me, about change, what I’m not used to, versus: these are really things that need to be addressed. Hard to tell the difference at first. Scary. Especially if the company owner really cares. They need to see the system working.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">As change agents help them have that experience and see that is really working. Help them see it’s really about them,&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">without telling them</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">, because sometimes it isn’t.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">If they have real tensions help them process them&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">through</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;the system because that will give them the confidence that the system works.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Help them to see that what people think of as control in a conventional paradigm is really more&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">illusion</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;than real control. Usually they know it even if they would never confess it. Mirroring approach.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Illusion of control: centralized power, plans and prediction that we are holding to. It doesn’t give us the control we think it provides.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Pointing out things to people</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">First assume it is&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;about them (even if you suspect it is) and help them try to work the tension&nbsp;<i>through</i>the system until it becomes blindingly obvious to&nbsp;<i>them</i>&nbsp;that it doesn’t need to get worked through the system, that it is just something they need to sit with.</b></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: italic;"><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Question: is an extra type of meeting needed besides strategy,&nbsp;</span>governance<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;and tactical meetings to process this?</span></p><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">No extra type of meeting for this needed, rather one-on-one coaching to help people understand how to use the system and how to process experiences.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A group process can work well, but the danger is to try to do the work that should go into the other meetings.</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">You don’t want to be over-explaining of things that need to be experienced</b></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">One of the early mistakes: not having individual or group coaching processes in place</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Interesting for personal development or executive coaching: felt dissonance that is experienced (it is not just cognitive) in this exposed position can drive development</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Really good fuel for these types of coaching, being a companion through the process, processing these personal tensions&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">parallel</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;but&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">separate</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;from what is going on organizationally</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Coaching founders: the most challenging of power and control issues</b></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">All these issues + they own most of the company from an investment standpoint, they built it from scratch, it is their baby</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Most founders have an intuitive sense that there is a healthy fusion with the founder that is not serving any more at some point.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Pitfalls: often being to attached or not being willing to let go, when it’s time to, getting their own stuff wrapped-up in it, it becomes “my company”, a complete identification / fusion, and it feels so right because it was necessary up to some point</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacracy forces the differentiation process from the start</span></li></ul><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span><br /><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Question: People who expect a lot of central control. How will people take part? Hints?</i></p><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">It is not a one-way- issue: people need to step up and claim their authority, whereas former leaders need to step back</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Help them understand: accountabilites also mean authorities. Their area, they own that.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">When roles are assigned help people understand that these roles are&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">theirs</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;to energize, no one else is going to do it or tell them what to do. Not even the leader has the authority to jump in.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">I don’t try to involve or engage people in the group process – that will come with time, instead I work through the roles and help them see nobody else is going to do it</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Tactical meetings: leader should remind folks that they have the authority&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">already</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;to make things happen.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">You can almost&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">pro-actively give the permission</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;that has already been given on a regular basis until people get it, because in operational meetings you’re talking about the execution of the work anyway</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">“The authority is defined, you fill the role, go make that happen!”</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The Founder Issue:&nbsp;</b><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Even some of the most intelligent, aware, mature individuals, when they’re in the founder role&nbsp; feell like they have a baby to protect, have a big challenge with the attachment to it, the identification with it, and it quickly turns from protecting to smothering.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacracy will hold up a mirror and be a challenge for that founder – to view that organization as an own entity and let go of the power, they’re used to holding</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">“my company” starts sounding dirty, once you’re used to Holacracy</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">It’s not that. It’s an organization and has its purpose</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Parent metaphor: good parent means being fused in the&nbsp;</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">beginning</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;and letting go, but not too early and not too late.&nbsp;In both cases the child is being hurt.</span></li></ul><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">·&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Question:“What’s the ultimate trump-card in Holacracy?”</i></p><ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The founder believes he has ultimate control and use it in a benevolent way</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">“I let you do what you want until it is outside my own limits of tolerance and then I pull the ultimate trump-card.”</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Sometime it is even worse: It is not a&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">direct</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;rejection but they still say “Yes, we’re going to do it” while at the same time they&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">undermine</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;the process. They ignore the established governance, they act as if it’s not there and as if they’ve complete control and they’re even doing it unconsciously.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">It happens a lot and it is really difficult to address.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">For any organization to outlive its founder this differentiation has to happen, even in conventional companies. The founder issue is ubiquitous.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacracy helps facilite it</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The board ultimately holds a lot of control at its level of scale</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Governance is where ultimate authority resides. It is the ultimate authority vehicle for the organization</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A relieve: “this is not my authority” - I can let go of the rest. I am not going to suck it all up because of my position. I am going to be a good follower of the authority of other roles.</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">We separate investment from power</b><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">. A subtle way in which Holacracy shifts the notion of power and control.</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Just because you’re an investor or an equity stakeholder in an organization doesn’t convey power.</b></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Authority is defined in governance. Governance occurs at every level of scale from the board down.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The board is the control point through its practice of governance. It’s the board that is surfacing the aim, filling the lead-link to carry that aim forward in the executive body of the organization. The board, through integrative decisionmaking, decides and has that ultimate control for the organization. That is quite different from shareholders.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A friend, founder of a company, implemented Holacracy, ran into a trap: fear came up and she grabbed back one of the distributed authorities from one role and said: “It’s my money at stake! I can’t let that happen.” Really challenging. Because of that she held to the control, thereby not letting another role do their job, which was the very thing that was endangering her money.</span></li><li><b style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Blurred boundaries: an&nbsp;<i>investor</i>&nbsp;is showing up in your actual company meeting operationally, which is<i>horribly dysfunctional.</i></b></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">People&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">can</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;be both investors and show up in an operational role: but&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">not</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;show up&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">as</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;investors in circle meetings in the company.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">That was an ultimate trump-card: nobody can argue with that. It is true and reflects a real pain, but it is hurting the organization.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacray makes it very clear that this is a boundary violation, even though it is commonly thought of as normal behavior. It doesn’t solve the problem, but makes it more visible.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacracy bakes in clarity in the form of a self similar system from bottom to top.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Lead-Link is a fairly small role that doesn’t take very much time. Tom does less than 2% of his time filling his lead-link role. Most of it goes to other roles he fills.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Confusion of “Lead-Link” with “Leader” (in a conventional sense)</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">In HolacracyOne the “CEO role” was created in the beginning but it didn’t make sense. There wasn’t any actual ongoing activity in the CEO role as we defined it.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Lead-link is mainly about resource allocation and prioritization, the work-load on a lead-link is miniscule.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">In the case of the investor now you can at least say “What role are you speaking from? That is not a role in the circle, that has nothing to do with it.” It is easier to point out the boundaries.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">There’s just communication between equal roles, not between boss and subordinate.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Holacracy gives you the tools to highlight the difference, to point to it, reminding people of governance as the ultimate framework for authority.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">The founder in the example was for the first time ever able to see why this was dysfunctional, why she needed to not show up like that. It was actually disempowering people from helping this organization from being everything it could be. It was all bottlenecking back to her.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A Lean principle: eliminating any waste, eliminating anything that is not actually helping the organization achieve its aim or purpose, or deliver on that.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">In Holacracy the question “Who’s the boss?” doesn’t really have a good answer – other than “the process of governance decides and carries the authority.”&nbsp;</span><i style="letter-spacing: 0px;">There is no boss in Holacracy.</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;There may be roles that coordinate work and service delivery that coordinate with other roles to get that done. But it is about role-relationships, not about the boss.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">It is pushing on those self-limiting concepts we have. “Boss” is such a vague, abstract term. What does that mean? Holacracy breaks that down and tells us exactly what roles there are and which authorities and accountabilities they have.</span></li><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Prepare for “ego-shock” when Holacracy is started.</span></li></ul>    </div>
