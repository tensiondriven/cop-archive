  <dd>Which role to create first, LL or Facilitator?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>When you begin the organisation, you are the only one, u begin with taking which role? Facilitator or Lead Link? Also if people from the organisation leave and you are all alone, I would say its transition time, you cant take both the roles of facilitator and lead link so what role is best to keep. Is it good to have only the facilitator who looks for more people to join or to be a lead link of the project and find facilitator and other people?</dd>
