  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>I couldn't find any clue in the constitution, from what I understand, if merging two roles, the new role would simply have combinations of the two roles (assuming this is the validated proposal in governance), but in the case of two circles? what should happen? Do we simply move the roles into the new circle? how about policy, domain, etc?</dd>

<p>As far as I understood (and also as it is implementer in Glassfrog) you don't just merge two roles or two circles. Instead you:</p><ul><li>remove existing roles (circles);</li><li>create new role (circle) with a new purpose;</li><li>add need accrountabilities (roles) to this circle;</li></ul><p>As far as you see circles as simply roles from a point of super-circle, then you should merge them also on super-circle Governance meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
