  <dd>Hello, everyone! I have a tension. During our first tactical meeting we found many agenda items wich should be addressed to governance meeting. It was very painfull issues wich we wanted to process immediatley. And we had no time to wait next apropriate meeting, I mean Governance. My question is: what do you think about combining two types of meeting into one? Especially at the first steps of the holacracy adoptation, when nobody has understanding about anything. Thanks!</dd>
