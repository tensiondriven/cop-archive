  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>3.3.1 says "In addition, the Lead Link and any Rep Links or Cross Links to the Circle may each invite up to one additional person, solely to aid the link in processing a specific Tension. The invited participant then becomes a Core Circle Member as well for the duration of that Governance Meeting." If one additional person is present will be processing only a specific Tension ("solely to aid in processing a specific Tension") or also the other tensions expressed "for the duration of that...</dd>

<p>[@mention:491073019750087335]&nbsp;As this person is considered as a core circle member during the meeting,&nbsp;in my interpretation she may do anything allowed by the process, like asking clarifying&nbsp;questions, giving a reaction, an objection (NVGO&nbsp;for instance) and participate during integration if any.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>My&nbsp;interpretation is that&nbsp;she&nbsp;would not be able to process other tensions because she&nbsp;would not be able to raise valid objections. In that case, she would be a Core Circle Member for the duration of the Governance Meeting (check-in, administrative concerns, building agenda, closing) but only for the specific tension. Is my interpretation correct? Thanks.</p>      </ul>

<p>Francesco, the Constitution states what Bernard Marie says (art 3.2) but I agree with you that it is a bit of.</p><p>One of the main concerns is that these people will not Propose or Object from a role that is part of the Circle and therefor, most of the time, either will have invalid Proposals or Proposals that have nothing to do with the Circle's Governance or will object to help another Role or the Circle in general.</p><p>In practice you see that these Invitees only take part in the Process when the specific Tension is handled. Agree with you that the Constitution is vague in this sense.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </ul>
