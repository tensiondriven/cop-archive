  <dd>Tension Infographic</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>In our new Holacracy practice (2 months old at this point), we have found it a little bit challenging to get people to properly state their tensions in governance. We put together the attached image, and it has helped to some degree. In particular it has helped us as facilitators in testing proposals (3.2.3). I would be curious if others find it to be helpful (or even accurate).</dd>
