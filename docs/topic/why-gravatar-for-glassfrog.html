  <dd>Why Gravatar for Glassfrog ?</dd>

  <dt>Extract</dt>
  <dd>Hi, I wander why using Gravatar/Word Press for the profile picture in GlassFrog ? Word Press is (at least in France) not very representative and sometimes black listed in some companies (don't ask me why ) Initially I though it might have been a storage issue, but for the Community you're not using gravatar and do store a picture. Any change forseen on this matter in Glassfrog ? (at least being able to chose Word Press and direct upload of a picture ?)</dd>

<p>And I just got an update from Product Manager that currently the plan is to move away from Gravatar so people can upload their own pics.</p><p>Also, if you log in using Google, GlassFrog will use your Google profile pic.&nbsp;</p>      </ul>

<p>I agree with you Xavier, already told it to GlassFrog support several times as our clients don't know how to use it and thus, don't upload any picture which is a pity... Too complicated!</p>      </ul>
