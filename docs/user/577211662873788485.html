To deliver our services, and to support our operations, the charity uses volunteers. My question is about how to fit that reality into the Holacracy approach. Is the way to go about this t...</a>    </div>

<a href="/reply/577211663099032755">There is so much in the nuance in the language used here. The term &#39;The Constitution&#39; resonates, in my view, very differently for a US citizen than it does for citizens of other countries. The UK, for example, doesn&#39;t have a written constitution, so it would be rare to hear a reference to a const...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/577352400443435045">I think I have found the answer to my question. The Partnership system is a great model to use, with its different levels of member. I see that a volunteer is akin to a &#39;Community Member&#39; on the relevant pages on the GlassFrog site.There is sooo much to learn!Ian</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/578197182548029987">Illuminating and a bit of a relief, thanks, Brian. This is great. I can now see how to reassure him (which is a big part of it), as well as show him how the tools can work for him, so he can see and then experience how he and the organisation can move beyond existing challenges.</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/581293801007885987">The community theatre example is a great one for a number of reasons, Rachel.

<a href="/reply/582983104103887929">Very creative and sounds effective. It is coming across as good way to provide clarity about expectations, set boundaries, and enhance confidence for all, including the volunteers.
