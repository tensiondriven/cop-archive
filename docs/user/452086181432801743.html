<a href="/reply/455041693885982236">As you can see there isn&#39;t a &quot;right way&quot; - which is as it should be since every organisation is different.

<a href="/reply/455041693886155261">TL;DR - there&#39;s a good fit but be careful - use Holacracy&#39;s ability to surface tensions and Scrum&#39;s Inspect and Adapt cycle to keep in balance also keep the bigger picture in mind. As with so much be sensitive to context.
