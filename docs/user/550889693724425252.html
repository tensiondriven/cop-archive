<a href="/cop-archive/topic/merit-money-based-app">OK, this is my first try in building an app and I might be over-ambitious with this.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/551030431236108342">That indeed was very helpful when we started implementing! To change mindsets, we demanded that everyone stated from which role s/he was asking something of which other role. That helped clarify a lot what role had the tension and what other role was thought able to (help) solve it.</a>      </div>
