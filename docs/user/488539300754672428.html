<a href="/cop-archive/topic/how-to-quickly-process-governance-tensions">Hi All, Do you employ any strategies that help you more quickly process asynchronous tensions? I am running into a situation where there are a lot of asyncs/tensions, and finding meeting time to process them all is difficult. I&#39;ve heard some accelerating async acceptance time and using slack as a...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563274169701">In theory I agree with you about a special governance. However some circles I am in would benefit from something along the lines of below:In Holacracy training in December, Sam Spurlin mentioned a &#39;flash governance&#39; approach using slack. I may pilot this for a sub-circle. There is an admin featur...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563274583471">I disagree. It&#39;s not amending the governance process, it&#39;s just using another channel to execute it. In the plan I outlined we still are using the asynchronous process through Glassfrog, just expediting and giving the room for feedback through slack. Still uses the IDM process. In 3.2.1 of consti...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563274665618">I think you can pick this apart in countless ways, because ultimately, all of these tensions could probably been solved by some governance sessions.What I gain from this is that to sustain Holacracy over time, organizations need a set of &quot;champions&quot; and &quot;drivers&quot; of Holacracy. It&#39;s about more tha...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563275518700">@eric that is correct. The attention points policy can be accessed here: https://glassfrog.holacracy.or...icies/3628?locale=enIn a nutshell, lead links of each circle allocate a number of &#39;attention points&#39; to each role. A full-time role equivalent = 100 attention points. For example, if I hold t...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563275584173">With all that said, attention points aren&#39;t needed to do role review. I think that encouraging practitioners to regularly review their own roles and roles they interact with is best practice. And it can&#39;t just be a handful of people, everyone should be doing it, and comfortable with making needed...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563282074969">I agree with all points, and we in general are practicing in that way. My original intention was to discuss ways to make the async process work better in itself, perhaps by leveraging a tool like Slack. This is more of an experiment that likely a smaller sub-circle would use, not a means to repla...</a>      </div>

I am aware of what you wrote, and the details around asynchronousproposals (we do use them, with a 5 day period).I&#39;m looking for other ways / strategies to make this more efficient. OneI&#39;ve heard is to use a slack channel to pitch an async before proposing togarner feedback, and then subm...</a>      </div>
