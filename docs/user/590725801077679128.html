<a href="/topic/holacracy-and-profit">In a &quot;normal&quot; company the goal is profit for the shareholders. In other words the managers are tasked with directing the work so that positive economic results (profits) would be produced and passed on to shareholders (investors, founders etc.). This may seem at odds with Holacracy with its empha...</a>    </div>

<a href="/reply/590444326092345057">I was thinking about introducing two amendments (to 4.1):- making it explicit that Ratifiers can select/change the Anchor Circle LL,- creating special policies that I would call Core Policies for lack of a better name that come from the Ratifiers and can be changed by them. Something like this:Am...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/590725801099246293">[@mention:576648489231374882], thank you for your ideology-free reply. Your perspective is what I was looking for. Specific questions:- did it require any amendments to the Constituiton?- did it cause any specific policies/domains etc. in the GCC?(Of course as far as you are willing to share thos...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/590866538593122242">Hey [@mention:449693036223847456] So good to see your reply here. Been a while since the workshop in Dec 2014.  I know what you wrote is true, profits are better if there is a purpsoe and Holacracy is not incompatible with generating profit in principle, but this is not exactly what I am looking ...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/590866538644816861">Thanks for your input.Well, I don&#39;t think the Ratifiers have enough ongoing influence. They need a tool from outside of the Anchor Circle to set policies just like normally shareholders/board give direction to a company by giving goals to the CEO and other executives.
