<a href="/cop-archive/topic/secretary-and-facilitator-as-single-roles">Article 2.3 states the Core Circle Members are: Partners filling Defined Roles, Lead Link, Rep Link(s) to the Circle and Cross Link(s) to the Circle (+ special appointments). It struck me that Secretary and Facilitator were not mentioned. Why is this? Article 2.5 states that only Core Circle Memb...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/time-as-an-objection">During a Governance meeting, an objection was made with regards to creating a new Sub-Circle. The harm introduced was: - I fill Roles in both Circles - It will take me more time to attend Gov&amp;amp;Tac meetings in two Circles Using the objection-testing questions I couldn&#39;t point out his objection ...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/lead-link-not-working-in-glassfrog">I&#39;ve found GlassFrog to do a very good job at technically incorporating the Constitution, but I can&#39;t explain why one can&#39;t address the Lead Link in any Actions or Governance... The Lead Link can be adressed in certain actions right? e.g. &#39;Inform @lead_link of preference for Focus Area for Role X...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/objection-testing-certainty-of-impact">Earlier this week during objection testing, someone (from an IT company, where people take wording very strictly) remarked that the question &#39;Do you know this impact will occur? or are you anticipating this impact is likely to occur?&#39; is a &#39;stupid&#39; (literally he said this) question, because one c...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/external-documents-to-support-governance-proposals">I was recently part of a Governance meeting, where a Proposer brought up a slideshow to support his Proposal. He did so in the &#39;Present Proposal&#39; round. People instantly started to frown because they were afraid it would take a lot of time, but technically I didn&#39;t see reason to object to this: t...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/domains-more-to-increase-clarity-less-to-increase-flexibility">I have the following question on Domains; in general, is more domains desirable for clarity of governance? Or, should you only create domains when unconstrained access can damage the organisation? Based on maximising speed of an organisation I would say the latter, but maximising governance trans...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/domain-delegations-and-initial-circle-authority">I have a question regarding the last paragraph of article 2.1.3 (Delegation of Control): &#39;In any case, all Domain delegations are always limited to whatever authority the Circle itself had in the first place&#39;.
