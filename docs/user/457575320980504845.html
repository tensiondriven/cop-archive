<a href="/reply/470242514094457616">Hi Frederick,That&#39;s an interesting question, especially since OKRs are gaining in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. In my opinion there are a couple conflicts between Holacracy and the OKR philopshy. The first is in how OKRs are defined. OKRs assume the existence of a management hierarchy...</a>      </div>

Each circle member can also give progress updates on any other projects that they&#39;d like. I find that the 4.0 constitution was clearer about the checklist items. -Eric</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/479953975191474047">Hi Giuseppe,It would depend on the type of tension. If this is an operational tension the Organizer role-filler can of course talk to the Communication role-filler or any other roles in any circle to try and get the tension resolved.

<a href="/reply/480235450204267382">Thanks Brian, that is indeed very helpful. I was using &quot;governance tension&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;you sense that the tension may be caused by unclear accountability or authority&quot;, but definitely see the potential pitfall of people classifying tensions as either &quot;operational&quot; or &quot;governance&quot; and how...</a>      </div>
