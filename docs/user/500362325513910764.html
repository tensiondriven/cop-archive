<a href="/cop-archive/topic/tactical-meetings-gcc-and-general">Hi Everyone, We are in the early stages of our Holacracy implementation and are loving the positive effect it has had on our business. As part of this early learning stage we have encountered some scenarios that we aren’t 100% sure what the correct approach is and wanted to ask for guidance pleas...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/3-3-6-integrative-election-process">Hi, Scenario We just had a Governance meeting and a few anchor role elections. We had a tie which we couldn&#39;t seem to break. Having gone back to review the Holacracy constitution 4.1, we confirmed the following: If there is a tie for the most nominations, then the Facilitator may do any one of th...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/exporting-roles-from-glassfrog">Hi, Just curious, how do people &quot;export&quot; roles and accountabilities from Glassfrog? I understand that unlike a conventional &quot;Position Description&quot;, you energise roles but if an employee needs to show what roles they were energising at a given point of time, is there an easy way to achieve this?

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/504725263546990059">Thanks everyone for the input on this. We ended up doing what Jan said and flipped a coin and broke the tie! :-). Kevin, I agree that it would be ideal if there were fewer options, as that would make it easier. Margaux, yes I too have witnessed how the process can be manipulated. I think as an or...</a>      </div>

I don&#39;t believe there to be any contradiction and I think your policy is fine.
