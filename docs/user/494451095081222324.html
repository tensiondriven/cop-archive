<a href="/reply/510355042155803755">Hi Ruben,What I learned during the training is that an objection is not invalid perse because you are anticipating something. If the possible impact is significant, anticipating this is enough of a reason for the objection to be valid. If it&#39;s not significant, you can just give it a try and see w...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/566654706152169664">Hi,I would suggest that you try to find out what the tension is, in a open being-curious kind of way. Maybe the former management colleague has a valid tension but has difficulty to process it the new way and falls back in old behaviour.
