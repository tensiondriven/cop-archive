<a href="/topic/open-organizations-in-glassfrog">A very interesting way to learn, when implementing Holacracy, is by simply checking how others do it in GlassFrog.   Other than  HolacracyOne  and  Evolving Organisation , are there other open examples out there? Maybe a directory?...</a>    </div>

<a href="/reply/456026929161196003">This is very helpful for companies moving towards self-management. There are in fact several aspects that need work and a table summarizing them is great. Then, for every aspect, it exposes the possible little steps to enhance the practices of each of them, smoothly and constantly. Great table!

<a href="/reply/456026929183845605">@Fajar, I have my way of understanding your problem which may be right... don&#39;t take this as final, because I&#39;m not a coach. Ideally Lead Links would not interfere on the Roles domain decisions, but in the other hand the Circle can define Policies that specify that Roles should obey to the Lead L...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/456026929183968793">Thanks for sharing, Koen! I see that this is a common practice around Holacracy coaching companies. It would be wonderful to see other kinds of companies... maybe more complex as well. Anyway, I understand that it is hard to have something like that. I was just curious </a>      </div>
