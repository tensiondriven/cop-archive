<a href="/topic/assigning-tensions-in-tactical">I noticed in triaging issues in the tactical meeting menu that a tension can not be assigned to a role but only to a person.

<a href="/reply/491213757273843506">For me the word tension serves as a fish trap. To quote some ancient Chinese wisdom: “The fish trap exists because of the fish.

<a href="/reply/535126034096649280">Hi All, thanks for the responses. I can follow the reasoning that a tension on governance starts from a person, and since the purpose of a tactical is clarification, I think it would also make sense to give the option to assign it to a role in glassfrog as Alexia suggests.</a>      </div>
