<a href="/cop-archive/topic/sub-circle-rep-link-assigned-action-in-tactical">In one of our tactical meetings the Rep Link of a sub-circle brought up an issue. The resolution was information that they were going to take back to their circle. We try to have a good practice in recording actions and projects and assigning them to roles. However, we noticed that Rep Link of th...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/455323168904057165">I&#39;ve been thinking about this (gamification of Holacracy) a bit and I&#39;m thinking that this will be a key tool to help us ramp up maturity and excitement in our implementation. I don&#39;t know much about gamification and would love others with more experience chime in.  I did start to brainstorm a mo...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/485865147777586031">That sounds like a frustrating situation.To &quot;yes, and&quot; Margaux&#39;s feedback, I&#39;ve found it useful to force good habits around people being specific about what they need. For example, after the circle member described the Rep Link issue, immediately jump in (cutting other people off) and asking the ...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488961583745191186">Not intending to say that at all.However, accountabilities are a more precise restriction i.e. Role X: &quot;Creating applications using colors specified by Role Y&quot; rather a broad restriction i.e Domain: &quot;Application Color&quot; which would, at the very least, restrict all roles in the circle.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/490369024541169420">The amazing Paul Walker&#39;s suggestion is a good way to systemically solve the problem and scale it out to other circles.

I wish we were at a point past all those questions so that I could give you concrete answers. The only thing I can add is that we are stealing a page from another company practicing Holacracy and intend to identify fractional FTEs to roles.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/562994781823100526">1. Awesome that circle members are bringing up tensions to process in governance2. That specific accountability appears to be a combination of a Project &quot;Establishing a role&quot; and an expectation already in the constitution &quot;Energizing a role&quot; therefore, redundant.
