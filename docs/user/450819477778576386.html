<a href="/cop-archive/topic/sub-circle-rep-link-assigned-action-in-tactical">In one of our tactical meetings the Rep Link of a sub-circle brought up an issue. The resolution was information that they were going to take back to their circle. We try to have a good practice in recording actions and projects and assigning them to roles. However, we noticed that Rep Link of th...</a>    </div>
