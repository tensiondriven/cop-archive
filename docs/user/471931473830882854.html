<a href="/cop-archive/topic/secretarial-cleanups-of-governance-records">I thought that the constitution provides for the Secretary to regularly edit the governance records for style, punctuation, and grammar, as well as clerical errors so long as he or she doesn&#39;t change the substance of the governance at question. I can&#39;t seem to find that in the Constitution. Can s...</a>    </div>

This is a survey I created that I send to all my Partners every quarter to assess their opinions of their Role-Fit. I am really curious your opinions on this and suggestions for it.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/551030431292838577">We are a 12 person distributed team with members all over the world.  We use Zoom and Slack, but I do think it is very key to have at least some in-person meetings as well.  It is a lot easier to learn the process and get good at facilitating when you meet in person.</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/551452917236891455">We meet in person 4 times a year currently, and we are strongly considering raising that to 6.  It is definitely an improvement, but I also think there is some natural limit to the improvement based on frequency of in-person.  For example, I am not sure that 12 times a year would be twice as good...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/562994781806231748">I would very much support clarifying this in the constitution.  I know that H1&#39;s position seems to be that the LeadLink is included as a member of the supercircle, but I don&#39;t believe this is at all clear in the text of the constitution, and this has led to confusion in my organization.</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/562994781814168228">No idea.  Here&#39;s my best stab at it, if I were Secretary.  If the accountability was &quot;Energizing the role X&quot;, where X was another role, I would say that it is NVGO.  Based on that logic, I would probably say that this is NVGO too.</a>      </div>
