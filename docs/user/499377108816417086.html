<a href="/reply/557082884609061297">Thanks for working on this book, Brian. I can share my point of view.What I was hoping to gain from operating as a Holacracy was to able to protect the organization from the influence of self-interested agendas and to be able to allow freedom to operate (which I highly value, as a long-time self-...</a>      </div>

<a href="/reply/560601683759882008">Thanks for posting, Mike. I believe you address some very core issues affecting the decision to implement Holacracy or not. I have also been on a journey of investigation with Holacracy over the past year, and I concur that there is no substitute for training and experience ...particularly experi...</a>      </div>
