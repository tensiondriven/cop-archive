<a href="/cop-archive/topic/policies-affecting-all-functions-and-activities-within-the-circle">Hello! In our organization I&#39;ve noticed a tendency to create &quot;policies&quot; which are actually just rules to govern behavior or norms, and while I&#39;ve always felt this wasn&#39;t really valid but I&#39;m not sure I know enough about policies to be sure. As per §2.1.2 and §1.3 of the constitution it&#39;s implied ...</a>    </div>

That video and the example of how you do behavioral agreements was huge for me (coming from the other thread about policies that try to limit people behavior.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/590725801579196599">Isn&#39;t though this the point of good facilitation? You can&#39;t expect everyone in the organization to become holacracy masters, but you don&#39;t have to because if a facilitator is doing their job well, they make it their business to help people find the pathways to solving their tensions, whether they...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/590866538908103370">Thanks both.Chris: makes sense that we would still have agreements outside of governance that would guide our behavior with one another, thanks for clarifying. So essentially what you&#39;re saying is that we could easily create documentation to &quot;govern&quot; our human obligations to one another and that ...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/590866538947643688">Thanks Anne, that&#39;s very interesting and really great to hear about how other orgs are tackling these issues. I wonder though if your solution actually solves the problem - the problem being that a role is not a person, and can&#39;t be held accountable for &quot;people&quot; things. But I might also not be un...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/592274973635447026">We&#39;re dealing with this very thing at the moment. Holacracy doesn&#39;t itself speak about personal space quite deliberately, since the idea is to separate role from soul. Holacracy deals with role and leaves you to sort out soul.What we&#39;ve done recently is create a &quot;Team Spirit Agreement,&quot; a documen...</a>      </div>
