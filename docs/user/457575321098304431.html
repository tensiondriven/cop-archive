<a href="/cop-archive/topic/validating-a-governance-objection-based-on-overlapping-accountabilities">As a Lead Link I found myself objecting to a proposal that created overlap in accountabilities between two roles. My tension was that it&#39;s unclear which role I can ask to do something. I have 2 questions about this: 1. My tension was &quot;anticipating&quot;, because I hadn&#39;t had to ask a role to do someth...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/457575321098375997">Haven&#39;t read the entire thread, but to answer your question from our perspective; we use OKRs to define our strategies.

Spend 20% time on role A and 80% on role B&quot;.Most importantly because that would be predicting and controlling and why would you want to do that? However, it&#39;s encouraged (co...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/488398563293291777">@Kevin / @Dien, on shared feeling of ownership, I see 2 angles:The Circle often has this &quot;shared&quot; feeling, people do tend to feel connected to its purpose and not just their own roles.

Does &quot;distributed all authorities across the Circle to all Circle Members&quot; mean that you&#39;ve governed all accountabilities that the LL normally has, to other (or all??) circle roles?
