<a href="/cop-archive/topic/removing-an-accountability-limiting-role">Hey, we had last time an objection in a Governance meeting, in which we had difficulties to figure out if it&#39;s a valid objection or not. Part of the proposal was to remove an accountability from a certain role. The role filler of that role objected, because she saw that accountability necessary. ...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/org-space-personal-space">Hi everyone, I&#39;m looking for some ideas/experiences how to cover the &quot;Org Space meets Personal Space&quot; issue in a way that it makes sense for an organization that practices Holacracy. Meaning: How to do things like Holidays? I stumbled upon https://blog.holacracy.org/policies-governing-people-in-h...</a>    </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/581575276035952318">Thank you Dennis!Yes indeed, I agree that would be a workable option. Just I feel here I couldn&#39;t have solved my problem with it, because I had this tension as Lead Link of the General Circle.I&#39;m personally neither filling the Outreach nor the Legal Guardian role.

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/586924462014631889">Hi Marco,I think with us this just has a bit to do with &quot;Holacracy Maturity&quot;. We&#39;re not fully there yet when it comes to individual tension resolving - and any step between like going through a rep is making it a bit easier to tell yourself &quot;probably that tension is not that important...&quot; and lea...</a>      </div>

<a href="/cop-archive/reply/587065199505807829">We&#39;re facing a similar issue, having 12 role fillers for one role. It&#39;s a trade-off. Having all partners as core members in the circle, slows down Gov and Tactical meetings a lot.Excluding them and having them represented in the meeting by just one partner, makes the meetings more efficient, but ...</a>      </div>
