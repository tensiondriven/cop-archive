<a href="/cop-archive/topic/what-metrics-are-and-what-not">Does anyone have a clearer definition of metrics in Holacracy? The constitution does not define the concept and solely covers how to handle the &quot;things called metrics&quot;, while the glossary says: “Data” and not “information”.

<a href="/cop-archive/topic/are-strategies-and-priorities-an-implicit-domain-of-the-lead-link">Domain ambiguity It is my interpretation that the above paragraph of the Constitution creates, by making explicit of &quot;who may do what&quot;, an implicit &quot;Priorities and Strategies of the Circle&quot; domain and delegates it to the Lead Link.
