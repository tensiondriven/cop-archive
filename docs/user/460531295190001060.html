<a href="/topic/mapping-teams-to-circles">We are in the early stages of adopting Holacracy and have started with mapping our existing organisational structure to circles. While not difficult, it has highlighted an issue between our team-centric way of organising and Holacracy&#39;s role-centric...</a>    </div>

<a href="/reply/461375793805324138">BrianThank you for the reply, I&#39;ll try to provide a little more context to the question.The teams are cross-functional but largely undifferentiated with no driver to have them differentiate.

<a href="/reply/476575990166755698">Yes, Team P and Team T to be specific. Each team circle belongs to the Delivery circle, which in turn is a part of the GCC. We toyed with no Delivery circle but decided it was necessary for the allocation of work - the Delivery Lead Link is responsible for allocating work to teams (we have an &quot;au...</a>      </div>
