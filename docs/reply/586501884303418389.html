  <dd><p>Good (and timely) question Keith!</p><p>We are just starting to go down the performance review path.&nbsp; We will be using a software tool to help us (PerformYard).&nbsp; We have a "HR coordinator" role that is responsible for the reviews but have not clarified what, if any, involvement the lead links might have in performance feedback.&nbsp; We have used paper evaluations from trainees for some of our "trainer" team in the&nbsp;past but have not had any other&nbsp;consistent performance feedback system for the team to date.&nbsp; I am also interested in how others are tackling this so thank you&nbsp;[@mention:454478741268114544]&nbsp;for&nbsp;starting&nbsp;the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some questions we have are:</p><p>When a partner/person is in multiple circles, how are the differnt lead links engaged?</p><p>Do you do performance review on&nbsp;people or on&nbsp;their ability to fill individual roles (role by role or overall picture)?</p><p>Do you look at the roles as well, especially where there are multi-filled roles and people are generally not succeeding in the role.&nbsp; Its a governance issue to solve but it might not be addressed until it becomes a performance issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
