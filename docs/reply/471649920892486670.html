  <dd><p>Hey Rebecca,</p><p>First, I echo everything Lex said&nbsp;about&nbsp;appreciating your&nbsp;feedback and push-back here! &nbsp;I'm actually the one who fills&nbsp;GlassFrog's Business Model role and&nbsp;drove this change, so&nbsp;I can&nbsp;clarify a bit: despite those data points, the overall intent&nbsp;and effect of the change was to lower prices for most smaller companies and raise them for most larger ones, and&nbsp;to be much more aligned with both market price levels and scaling patterns in&nbsp;other&nbsp;enterprise-class productivity software (e.g. Slack, Asana, Trello, and many others in this price range). &nbsp;As a result of this pricing change, most (but not all) of our smaller clients&nbsp;(below about 50 people) are paying less now, and most of our larger ones are paying more now. &nbsp;Sorry to hear your organization was among the minority of smaller organizations that&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;paying more - I know that sucks, and I hope you'll forgive us and find a way to keep loving our little frog... &nbsp;:-)</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
