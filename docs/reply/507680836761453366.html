  <dd><p>Does this mean that a Required Role filler has a de facto "veto" right to refuse a new or modified accountability, even if the Role description is the most obviously suitable Purpose for the added accountability ?</p><p>Let me give more background. We have a Production circle, in which there is a Stock Manager role (which buys stuff from suppliers) and a Machine Builder role, which uses stuff from the Stock to build products. That worked so far, but then we began using a software product, which requires a serial&nbsp;key to be provisioned from the software supplier. The Machine Builder role needed a serial key and wasn't sure who to ask it from, and while an informal process was currently in place, a discussion occured on who was supposed to provide that serial key (and hence provisioning it). Our intuition would be to solve the&nbsp;tension "There is no existing process to provision a serial key" by extending the "Stock Manager" role accountability "Provision hardware components from suppliers" to&nbsp;"Provision hardware and software from suppliers". However, the "Stock Manager"&nbsp;objected that it was software, not hardware, and that he had no time to process that new item on top of all other accountabilities he also had.</p><p>How would you takle that use case ?</p></dd>
