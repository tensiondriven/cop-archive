  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Jeffrey D. Kreh posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>Might using the phrase "your roles" lead to confusion? This phrase also appears in the constitution. It seems to me that the phrase "roles that you serve" or "the role you steward" is more respective of the organization.&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>@Jeffrey:&nbsp;At first I was super into your suggestion, but then when I got down to incorporating it into the proposal, it actually seem like it might add some confusion. It would also be impractical to make that edit in every instance of "role" within these proposals.</p><p>I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open to work this sentiment into governance without these drawbacks.</p></dd>
