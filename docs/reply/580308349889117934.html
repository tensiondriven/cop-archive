  <dd><p>Thank you Brian and Barbara!&nbsp; Appreciate your feedback and opinions.</p><p>[@mention:449693036223847456] - I see your point more clearly now.&nbsp; If one can reap all the benefits of a Benefit Corp (no pun intended) in an LLC, but with more freedom due to "<em>any set of&nbsp;governance rules",&nbsp;</em>why not go with the latter?&nbsp; Makes sense.</p><p>[@mention:498251187806746638] Thank you for referral.&nbsp; I just signed up for their newsletter.&nbsp; Looks very interesting but at initial glance, it seems more Europe based correct?&nbsp; Or am I mistaken?&nbsp; I've never heard of a Purpose Trust/Purpose Foundation per this link:</p><p><a href="http://purpose-economy.org/en/ownership/" target="_blank">http://purpose-economy.org/en/ownership/</a></p><p>I only know of revocable, irrevocable, and self-directed trusts here in US but the principles of a Purpose Foundation definitely resonate with me.</p><p>I guess one factor that's missing from this analysis is how this might impact the end investor's risk/reward profile &amp; appetite?</p><p>Thanks again all!</p><p>Cyrus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
