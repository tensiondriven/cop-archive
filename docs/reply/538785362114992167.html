  <dd><p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:456449141667144364], it's a great list of options for organizations new to this!&nbsp;</p><p>I noted a few points for improvement:</p><ul><li>Organization Steward <ul><li>The accountability "<em>Having a picture of where the organization stands currently based on input from the whole organization</em>" doesn't qualify as an accountability in my interpretation (i.e. NVGO), because it's an outcome (vs. an activity). Maybe it'd be best captured in the purpose, or you may want to specify a more concrete activity. Or just remove it, as&nbsp;it's probably necessary for doing the 2nd accountability anyway.</li><li>The accountability "<span><em>Translating organizational ideas to practical and working proposals and supporting others in these efforts</em>", due to how it's framed, could easily lead to proposals designed from mind vs. tensions. I think it's especially risky for new practitioners. I suggest replace 'ideas' by 'tensions'.</span></li></ul></li></ul></dd>
