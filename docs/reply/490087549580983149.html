  <dd><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding, Karilen. I look forward to your feedback once you read it!</p><p>Margaux, definitely a good call-out for the Rep Link going insane by having to go both up and down with the information. So far there have not been any issues, but as with any other part of this crazy experiment, as soon as issues start up, we shall address it in some way or another.</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;">"If everyone is a Lead Link, does that mean everyone can object to&nbsp;anything proposed in governance even if it doesn't fall in their roles / same for proposing something in governance of the circle?"</p><p>Correct! That is why alignment across the entire team is so incredibly important, but it also means we can all protect the Circle more efficiently than normal, so it has pros and cons.</p></dd>
