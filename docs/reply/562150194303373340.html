  <dd><p>Thank you Tom &amp; Dien,</p><p>When someone is sharing an information, often it transforms into feature brainstorming session, so I guess at this point, I should cut it off and ask the proposer what does he/she need.&nbsp;</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;I normally advice the facilitator to use that section of the constitution to explain, before the meeting, that the promise to all circle member is that *ALL* agenda items will be processed within the *time allotted* for the meeting. In order to do that the facilitator must cut off any agenda items that are taking too long.</p><p>Sometimes a new agenda is added during triage. So we thought there is enough time, but then the newly added agenda items couldn't be processed.</p><p>Slightly out of topic, but this 5 pathways, I can find it in <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings</a> but they are not explicitly stated in constitution right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
