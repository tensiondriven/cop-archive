  <dd><p>Hi Ruth,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm helping to implement holacracy in 2 start up organisations. Not all the members were thrilled about the holacracy way of working. Many questions and energy leak was the result. When the founders decided to work with holacracy for the minimum of 6 months with an evaluation after 3 months and by signing the constitution the energy&nbsp;leak stopped and everybody tries to make the best of it. It looks like work got back to "normal" again and the first benefits have been achieved: much&nbsp;more efficient&nbsp;meetings!</p></dd>
