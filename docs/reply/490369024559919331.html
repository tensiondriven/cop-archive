  <dd><p><a href="/member/462501715237924468">KRÃ†N</a>&nbsp;Few other thoughts in case they spark anything useful for anyone: Lead Link authorities can be delegated (such as to a distinct&nbsp;role for handling a particular function handled by LL by default) or constrained - such as a policy, requiring a conversation for example before removing from roles.</p><p>Also, in a mature Holacracy practice (less at the very beginning for some people), an individual has many roles, so removing from a role is not a huge authority in a way.</p><p>Wondering if those options balance out your concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>PS: I haven't gotten into the pull requests myself, so congrats on trying that out! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> Practicing and talking is much more my interest, and leaving the language updates or constitutional suggestions to others.</p></dd>
