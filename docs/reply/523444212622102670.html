  <dt>Body</dt>
  <dd><p>This thread brought up an old question of mine regarding how to set a policy that we want to limit just to apply to one circle and not the circles below it.</p><p>I have always assumed that "All functions within this circle" meant within that circle and all subcircles under it. Is this correct ?</p><p>Due to this, we have always specified in the policies themselves that the policies only apply to that circle and not the circles below it when we want to limit the policy only for that particular circle.</p><p>Are we doing it correctly ?</p></dd>
