  <dd><p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>I've also volunteered to translate GF into Spanish. But I'm guessing it has been built mono-linguistically so doing the first translation may be a little traumatic as they will have to hard code every tiny piece of text into a string variable that looks for a separate language file. After they've done the first one, adding new languages will be a piece of cake.</p><p>I'm hoping now we have the constitution and the meeting cards translated into Spanish and other languages that H1 will look again at bumping language translations up the GF backlog priority list.</p><p>Ciao</p></dd>
