<p>Thanks for the answer! I did not put it right. A person proposes to change the process defined by the constitution. Suppose this sentence is valid for him. One of the participants at the stage of objection can object to this proposal by referring to 3.2.4 Criteria for Valid Objections: "Processing or adopting the Proposal breaks the rules defined in this Constitution, or prompts the Circle or its members to act outside of the authority granted under this Constitution." He can explain this by saying that the restriction of the possibility of raising tensions is contrary to the basics of holacracy." The question is, is it possible to consider that such a proposal really violates the constitution? Or the objection can be removed by referring to the phrase "A Circle may adopt a policy to add to or<br />change this required process "from paragraph 4.2.3 of the constitution?</p>  </div>
