  <dd><p>I resonate with Tom's point here.&nbsp; Chris, while I&nbsp;strongly share&nbsp;your&nbsp;sense of the&nbsp; importance of encouraging objections, I think you're underestimating the subtle impact&nbsp;caused by failing to anchor Facilitator authority in the rules of the game here - yes, encourage objections, but not at the expense of this principle; there are other ways to do that with no downside, where here there's a substantial downside, and this isn't a tradeoff that needs to be made - you can have your cake and eat it too.&nbsp; Adam, the use of "we can" in your latest post hits that issue and I'd&nbsp;recommend avoiding it; the Facilitator should not be speaking for the "we" if there's any risk of someone else feeling like it doesn't capture their sense of things, and that's almost definitely the case here.</p></dd>
