  <dd><p>I looks like you got some good advice already&nbsp;[@mention:491213757235914012].

And it might be different reasons for different people. Based on that the best actions will be different.

You could then ask the person to define a personal process for making sure that they catch it and do it themselves, without you having to "poke" them. After all if you're doing that, that's because they're&nbsp;dropping something they are already accountable for. Concretely, you can ask them to capture a project (e.g. "Process in place to consistently add name on blog post spreadsheet every week" or whatever). Once the project is captured, you can ask for updates on <em>that</em>, and offer help (or even defining a role, e.g. "Personal Organization Coach") for how to do that best.

And if they say "no check" you can ask clarifying questions ("why didn't you do it? what got in the way?")</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;I'll emphasize what others have said: poking people because you're the <em>founder</em> is not a good reason, but poking because you are the Lead Link, or any other role that directly cares, is perfectly&nbsp;appropriate in Holacracy!</p><p>Hope that helps</p></dd>
