  <dd><p>Yep, it is true. It&nbsp;might feel a bit like talking about the sex of the angels (that it might be interesting too). However, I think it&nbsp;can be also somehow *useful* to&nbsp;raise that point because&nbsp;in my experience it is common to see strong&nbsp;resistance to&nbsp;some tough (masculine?) way of facilitating the process&nbsp; (ruthlessly crashing out-of-process interactions, as an example). If that perception was not triggered it would be easier for the framework to spread, IMO. My&nbsp;personal&nbsp;learning is: as a facilitator, try to&nbsp;outline the intrinsic neutrality of the process, explaining or compensating if needed.</p></dd>
