  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:575944726524854281],</p><p>With a GCC without LL, by default LL's accountability are expressed in governance (<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art522" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.2</a>)</p><p>So for instance regarding the GCC's strategy, you would go to the GCC governance (if you're core member of) and make a proposal for the circle' strategy, and will run through the usual IDM process.</p><p>In addition, if you feel like (tension) running through governance IDM process for any LL accountability expression is "too" heavy, you can still propose to distribute LL's accountabilities to different roles or app, the same way you would do in any circle.</p><p>Hope this help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
