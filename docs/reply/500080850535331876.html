  <dd><p>Yes!&nbsp; I think training in this area is critical for any organization running Holacracy.&nbsp; Without training on GTD methodology, you'll have trouble getting people to effectively leverage the system and maintain productivity as they transition to self-management.&nbsp; We have a couple of roles responsible for carrying out this kind of training.</p><p>Unlike one of the commenters above, we do not require any particular software/tool be used for trusted systems, only that each person have a reliable one.&nbsp; It comes up from time to time that perhaps by policy we should restrict to 1-3 tools so that we can drive greater alignment between people and get more detailed in our trainings, but we haven't taken that step yet.</p></dd>
