  <dd><p>Domain is property&nbsp;or a thing like Andrew says and as well in&nbsp; Article: 1.1</p><ul><li><strong>(b)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Domains”</em></strong>, which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization.</li></ul><p>In Holacracy people are not things, nor a resource. A partner is someone who is available to be assigned to a role. Resources are usually money so I will leave it at that for now. Resources could presumably be other things, so I do get the question; if money is a thing then indeed it could also be a domain, or controlled by a domain (fence).</p><p>I am hoping to help clarify both the constitution and the teaching of this going forward. It is a common source of ambiguity.</p></dd>
