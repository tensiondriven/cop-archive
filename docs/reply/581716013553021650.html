  <dd><p>This is the most incredible thread.&nbsp; I am so grateful for all your thoughts.&nbsp; I am dealing with a similar issue.&nbsp; Working in a startup that's just getting off the ground - trying to determine who gets equity and who is a volunteer and how to use Holacracy to manage all of that.&nbsp; Any suggestions or support would be greatly appreciated.</p></dd>
