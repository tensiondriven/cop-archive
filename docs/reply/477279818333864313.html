  <dd><p>Hi Keith,</p><p>I'll give you a gold frog! You're right, the election code dates back a while, and I think the constraint on electing to only circle members is in 3 or 4, so it was intentional at one point. We try to strike a balance between upholding the constitution, and giving folks flexibility in GlassFrog, so hearing how folks are using the elections is extremely useful for me, thank you! &nbsp;I hadn't thought about policies allowing electing folks outside of the circle, etc. &nbsp;I'll add it to my notes.&nbsp;Regardless, it will probably stay as it is for a while since&nbsp;we've got so many things that I'd like to see in GlassFrog.</p><p>Thanks!</p></dd>
