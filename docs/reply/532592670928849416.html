  <dd><p>Wow, if there are people interested in facilitation practice and we have experience practitioners or have Holacracy coaches, why don't we schedule a community practice group and for us to take turns facilitating governance and tactical meetings. Basically, its taking Brian's Holacracy business simulation during the Holacracy practitioner training and doing that online. Would anyone be interested in that? Would anyone have ideas of how to make that a reality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
