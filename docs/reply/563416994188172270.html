  <dd><p>I think it depends on what you mean by "up and running".</p><p>My impression is there is always a learning journey, always resistance - and different people will pass through it at different speeds. And part of the organisational experience will be: the (inter-personal and work-related) tensions that arise as a result of some people "getting" the system and using it before others.&nbsp;</p><p>Holacracy (like the world of work in general, but particularly self-managing work) assumes that people operate all the time from a certain stage of mindset (in Kegan's framework L4/self-authoring - seems to be about equivalent to the "Achiever" action logic). How many people are there yet, and how many people have to go on that journey&nbsp;in order to "get" will be a factor.</p><p>An added complexity: can you manage people into a self-managing system or can only point them in the direction of how they can manage themselves, and then wait patiently ("hold space") for them?</p><p>....</p><p>All that said, I think I agree with your rough estimate of six months for an SME - and a time frame of 1 - 2 years for true master of Holacracy, such that the forms drop away and all that is left is the lived truth of self-management.
