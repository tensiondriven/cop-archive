  <dd><div class="post-body" id="post_body_567780937530659763"><p>Hi Andrew - I focus most on what you say here: "Whilst in none of my roles can I direct work any longer, what's the Holacracy answer to encouraging end effects for individuals and circles?"</p><p>I think a focus on the opportunity one has to help clarify the external pressures into types of roles your organization needs to have, to get this work done, might perhaps be an area to consider, to help your tension.&nbsp;</p><p>You have the opportunity to see how those roles and circle activities are&nbsp;performing against&nbsp;client metrics such as delivery time and quality. New role fillers can be found to provide better metrics, or additional resources might be needed to aid certain roles.&nbsp; Hope this perspective might help you as well!</p></div></dd>
