  <dd><p>[@mention:491495232183315418]&nbsp;To add to Karilen's&nbsp;comment, I would create a Policy to allow excluded partners to participate in the election process if needed (i.e. real tension being sensed by someone)</p><p>And I would dive in more into the tension to get it deep. By experience, very often the exclusion process for minor allocation triggers emotion onto the excluded partners, as they feel personally excluded. In such case, by experience, there may be some other work to do with the people.</p></dd>
