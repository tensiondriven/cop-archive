<p>Bud wouldn't be the first person to e-mail Tony to&nbsp;tell him everything he's doing wrong around Holacracy and what to do to fix it (which usually involves using&nbsp;that person's system or consulting services instead)... &nbsp;Zappos and Holacracy are&nbsp;convenient targets for anyone interested in tearing&nbsp;something down to build up their own thing (or for journalists&nbsp;more interested in click-throughs on sensationalized headlines than, say, doing actual journalism).</p><p>Zappos seems to be doing great as far as I can tell,&nbsp;and it looks to me like they're artfully navigating&nbsp;the&nbsp;many&nbsp;challenges that come with&nbsp;a massive transformation and paradigm shift&nbsp;(from my own first-hand experience of them plus&nbsp;lots of conversations with people who work there). &nbsp;Per Ruben's point, if you want to&nbsp;know what's really going on in Zappos (or anywhere), check for first-hand accounts, and be wary of press and management-consultant bloggers...</p><p>Here's&nbsp;two more relevant articles with first-hand accounts (the one Margaux linked to is great as well, especially&nbsp;for a commentary... except the reference to Buffer trying Holacracy - that's a total press&nbsp;fabrication):</p><p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3055657/most-creative-people/the-zappos-exodus-wasnt-about-holacracy-says-tony-hsieh" target="_blank">http://www.fastcompany.com/305...racy-says-tony-hsieh</a></p><p><a href="http://www.zapposinsights.com/blog/item/thanks-for-all-of-your-concern-butan-inside-perspective-on-the-changes-at-zapposcom" target="_blank">http://www.zapposinsights.com/...changes-at-zapposcom</a></p>  </div>
