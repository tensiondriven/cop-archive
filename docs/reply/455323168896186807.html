  <dd><p>I hadn't thought of a point system per se, but I like that idea. The thought I had, that might work for my company at least, is a sort of scavenger hunt type of thing. We are looking into doing badges to show progress in other aspects of the company, and once you finished the scavenger hunt, you would earn your GlassFrog badge. Will have to think of another game type thing for the constitution, but we'll cross that bridge later.&nbsp;</p></dd>
