  <dd><p>[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;I like what you're trying to do. I didn't review it in depth (just skimmed through it), but I wanted to offer a thought: I think it can be very valuable, but in your effort make sure to not mix the Holacracy constitutional requirements and other things you'd like to expect that aren't constitutional (e.g. commitment to ongoing study of Holacracy,&nbsp;<span>commitment to a few practices regarding absence coordination and team communication, etc.)</span></p></dd>
