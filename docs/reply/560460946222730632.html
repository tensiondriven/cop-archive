  <dd><p>[@mention:450819477777465353]:&nbsp;my primary interest at this point is to observe whether&nbsp;players of “Little Bookcase Publications”&nbsp;v.3.0 start to understand the basic fundamentals of Holacracy via gameplay&nbsp;– i.e. how governance (roles, accountabilities) affects operations (projects, events, …) and vice versa. The secondary aim is to observe whether the game-mechanics are balanced enough to allow for a fun and engaging game. And … (see response to Isabelle Rappart, below)</p><p>[@mention:450678740272473756]: cheers, and great! If you are interested, please see above&nbsp;comments regarding&nbsp;that a PDF-DIY version might not necessarily have the same user experience to it as the exhibited version.</p><p>I will be working on setting things up over the weekend. As I’m a bit hesitant of using a shareable dropbox link, please comment below your email addresses (or send me direct message) and I’ll send you a download link to the PDF when I’m finished. That way I can attempt at keeping track of where things are going and who wants access.</p><p>In the meantime, please check out the&nbsp;<em>4. Findings</em> and <em>5. Conclusion</em> sections in the <a href="http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1623/1/Vidarsson_Egill_2017_MDes_DigitalFutures_LearningHolacracyThroughPlay.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Learning Holacracy Fundamentals Through Play thesis">thesis document</a>&nbsp;for more details regarding benefits and limitations of v.3.0 of the game, as well as <em>Appendix E</em> and <em>Appendix F</em>. This, I think, will help you to get acquainted with the game as “moderators” before&nbsp;running the game as it can be&nbsp;quite slow and sometimes frustrating if all players are learning a game at the same time.</p><p>For credit, I would greatly&nbsp;appreciate that&nbsp;you point your participants and colleagues to my portfolio (<a href="http://www.egillrunar.com/little-bookcase-publications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="An introductory board game to Holacracy fundamentals">http://www.egillrunar.com/litt...okcase-publications/</a>).</p><p>I’ll be in touch. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
