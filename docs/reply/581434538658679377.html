  <dd><p>Hi [@mention:449411339497350002],</p><p>Thanks for this precious work ! I guess that the post you're thinking about is this one, from&nbsp;[@mention:532592670943008396] :&nbsp;<a href="/topic/purpose-of-the-circle-member-role-filler" target="_blank">...e-member-role-filler</a></p><p>I'm not sure to get the sense of the following sentence from you're document :</p><p>● For all other roles, don’t object to a governance proposal because it contradicts a legacy policy. Let the governance conflict with it, thus creating an incentive for whoever wants to rely on that policy. The status quo is your enemy in this case.</p><p>Would you accept to give me an example, an illustration please ?</p><p>Thanks again !</p></dd>
