  <dd><p>Hi Gary,&nbsp;</p><p>what about this lead link taking up a product owner role himself? Irrespective of Holacracy role modeling the desired change could create some momentum. Just doing it instead of telling it.&nbsp;</p><p>I know a traditional (non holacratic) senior director that does this. He still enjoys taking up projects to just experience it himself and show what's possible.&nbsp;</p></dd>
