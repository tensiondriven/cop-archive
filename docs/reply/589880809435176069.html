  <dd><p>&nbsp;My current feeling of how I'd like to see it done goes like this:</p><p>Channels that map to roles/circles..</p><p>.. should be clearly recognizable as such. For example by a suffix "-role" or "-circle".</p><p>.. should have priority over others =&gt; make that visible and have it effect in the ordering of the channels. For example by prefixing the channel names with "_".</p><p>.. should be private by default. Circles are like cells, they should have a cell membrane that clearly regulates what goes in and what goes out. For that we have roles. If we don't do it, circles become undefined, with people from the outside coming in and "offering advice" and so on.</p><p>The private channel&nbsp;thing is not something I would want to have, but&nbsp;over the past years the lack of clarity became really an issue in our organization, I think.
