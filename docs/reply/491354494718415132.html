  <dd><p>Fred, thank you!</p><p>This is very interesting. If (and obly if!) it's not a bother, would you please give an illustrative example? An anecdote of a mundane work-related action - before Holacracy, and after?</p><p>This is actually what I am (and the board of my company is) searching for: a "film" to watch in their mind's eye, to get a "glimpse to the future" of what will the rooms and corridors look like under Holacracy.</p><p>Cheers! And again thanks anyway,</p><p>a</p></dd>
