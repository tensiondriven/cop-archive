  <dd><p>I don't see these as conflicting; in fact, the most effective way I know of to generate the best possible financial results for investors is to run a purpose-driven company, and put serving that purpose above maximizing short-term profits.&nbsp; There's a bunch of research out there that&nbsp;confirms this now as well.&nbsp; John Mackey's book Conscious Capitalism has a lot to say on this topic, and I really like how he puts it; you might find that worth a read.</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
