  <dd><p>Thanks Chris - once again that's really useful. I like the separation of 'need' or 'value' and what we use to meet that need. Sounds not dissimilar to some of the frameworks used in Landmark Forum training which I did many moons ago.</p><p>I think I agree that deep&nbsp;down&nbsp;our values/needs are not really in conflict and that we all need all of them but it also seems to me that an organisation or a group of people may decide to focus on one set of values rather than another as being their particular contribution to the larger conversation.</p></dd>
