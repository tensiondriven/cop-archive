  <dd><p>Gerald, you have me curious with&nbsp;</p><p>"Ultimately it is clear that there is no real need to have a works council in Orgs operating in Holacracy."</p><p>What makes you say that? Where do you take that clarity from? (I think I can see how that might be true, but I could just as easily argue the opposite at the moment, I think.)</p><p>I have worked with a large union in the past, and resonate with what Karilen says: I'd aim at&nbsp;including it fully, mapping it out as it is, and then letting it evolve through tensions. This might actually be attractive to unionists, as they might see it as a way to gain _more_ influence in the organisation! (Which _then_ even I could see as a <em>good</em> thing!)</p></dd>
