  <dd><p>Without knowing what the "Review status of all projects..." item looks like in one of your meetings, I can't say for sure. &nbsp;However, in general, a checklist item would be responded to during the tactical meeting with a simple "check" or "no check" indicating whether or not you completed the item (i.e., reviewing the status of your projects). &nbsp;On the other hand, during project updates, you would speak to what has actually changed on a project since the last tactical meeting. &nbsp;The difference being the level of detail reported (with basically no detail being given for a checklist item).</p><p>Again, without knowing details, it's tough to say, but I would guess that the checklist item is just ill conceived.</p></dd>
