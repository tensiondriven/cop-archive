  <dd><p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have the case with one of our client where they included only some people into the system because they work closely with them. Another way to do that is to create only one user that you can share with anyone willing to see your GF. It would only be a “viewable user” used by lots of people. We did that for another client because they wanted some people from the external world to see there GF without making it public.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>Have a nice day <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
