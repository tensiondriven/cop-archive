My current thinking is that we need on-site human interactions to run a company and take it to the next level - no matter the way people prefers to work given their interaction styles. And the more we have that type of interactions, the better. Every once in a while is not sufficient IMO but I guess it depends on the personality... Arg, so complicated...</p></div></blockquote><p>Thank you&nbsp;[@mention:449693036337664795]&nbsp;for clarifying more about what tension you are feeling. I think you&nbsp;may be sensing into something deeper than personal preferences. This tension may go beyond your personal preferences for work style and be something to process by reflection and dialog about what the tension is for the organization. At first I thought you were feeling the tension more about tribe space or the individual motivations space. But&nbsp;with your clarification that it is a question of survival,&nbsp;I wonder if it might be something to do with a deep organizational need you are sensing into.</p><p>I&nbsp;think it is important&nbsp;to honor all the Interaction Style differences&nbsp;when they are doing role work, but there are times when interaction is crucial, when solving some major problem or determining a major strategy shift is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Key to sorting this out is to be sure it is not a projection of our own preferences and needs and it seems you are doing this. I'd be happy to be a sounding board with you on zoom if you want.&nbsp;</p></dd>
