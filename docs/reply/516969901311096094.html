  <dd><p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>I've looked for a more relevant definition of Triage to help you (best what I could find:&nbsp;<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage" target="_blank"><a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage" target="_blank">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/triage</a></a>) but i think an exact definition is not going to give the answer.</p><p>I think triage in this context means: there is a tension, and you decide what needs to be done to reduces this: a next-action, a project or something else. Like with the patient (triage in medical terms), you assess what's needed and process the tension in the most suitable way. &nbsp;</p><p>So I think your understanding of the term triage is correct (for what it's worth as I'm not very experienced in Holacracy yet)</p><p>Joni</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
