  <dd><p>Hi Giovanna,</p><p>I think our two organizations have a lot in common with how we work with contractors and our main asset being IP and training materials.&nbsp; I wonder if a call to chat about how each of us has implemented&nbsp;holacracy&nbsp;and how we include contractors might help both of us with thinking about how other orgs are doing this work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From our perspective, we are in the process of implementing materials use agreements with each of our partnering trainers.&nbsp; We haven't really considered it with all the roles on our team.&nbsp; That is likely short-sightedness on our behalf.&nbsp; We do use copyright protection for some of our materials and are in the process of developing a creative commons licensing policy for other parts of our IP catalogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to sharing materials--we typically only share them with roles that use them.&nbsp; So our trainers will gain access to materials as they are needed for a specific session so that they can be studied and modified to the audience.&nbsp; That said, we are pretty loose with closing out project folders after an event or an kinds of access rules so most people could access them if they wanted.&nbsp; We are a virtual team and operate out of dropbox for file sharing&nbsp;which adds another level of complexity to the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Send me a personal message if a call might help with hashing out how each of us thinks about the work.&nbsp; I would certainly welcome the opportunity to hear more about your approach to working with a team composition like the one you described.</p></dd>
