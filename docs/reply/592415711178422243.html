  <dd><p>We have a small&nbsp;team and have dealt with vacation with a policy laid out by our operations circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its pretty simple, we have a spreadsheet where people track their time off. Before tracking your team off, you are required to send an email to the team stating your request&nbsp;and seeing if anyone has any issues.&nbsp; The point has been that generally people understand the need to have coverage and are open to ensuring that we are alway properly staffed.&nbsp; We considered&nbsp;the option of having to have things approved more formally but this has worked well so far. I think because the partners in particular roles understand the needs of the team related to having their roles properly staffed during absences.&nbsp; This seems in keeping with self organization principles and works well so far for our small team.&nbsp; I think it would be scaleable to a larger groups provided you thought fo time of in terms of smaller units of teams and coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
