  <dd><p>Chris, I’m so excited to see so many Pandemic players around!</p><p>On the topic of trying to mirror Holacracy’s need for role alignment by&nbsp;utilizing&nbsp;transparent, visual management (checklists, projects, metrics)&nbsp;to when&nbsp;playing Pandemic, the following data is transparent and for all to see at all times <em>in real-time</em>&nbsp;…</p><ul><li>Status of Cured / Eradicated&nbsp;Cures</li><li>Infection Rate</li><li>Players’ Cards (City Cards; Color, Name, etc)</li><li>Amount, Color and Placement of Various Disease Cubes on the World Map</li><li>Placement and Amount of Research Stations on the World Map</li><li>Player deck and discards</li><li>Infection deck and discards</li></ul><p><br />The difference, I think, might be&nbsp;that all of the players’ actions (moving, sharing knowledge, curing diseases, discovering diseases, infecting cities by revealing cards from infection decks (= stuff comes in?)) and the above data is not individually&nbsp;reported back to the group (à la Tactical Meetings), but is instead collectively reported in real time with everything transparent for all to see.</p><p>Do you know what I mean?</p><p>Hard to explain this, but when playing this kind of a board game, you are effectively in a mix of “Doing work in clear roles” <em>and</em> doing “Tactical Meetings and triaging next actions”.</p></dd>
