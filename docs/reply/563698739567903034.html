  <dd><p>Jenn,&nbsp;</p><p>Whoops! Hopefully, I fixed the video link. It should work now.&nbsp;</p><p>And yes, you're 100% right..."I think a policy that says "Doors remain locked until 7:30am." or "Entry is permitted after 7:30am" is not governing people but property." That is a great way of doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, how policies are phrased is extremely important. The letter of the law is just as the spirit. So, even though saying "No one may start working before 7:30am" may seem very similar to, "Doors remain locked until 7:30am" one would be invalid and other valid, even if they have the same intent.&nbsp;</p><p>By hours of operation, I was addressing how organizations typically try to regulate them, which is through things like "Everyone must arrive by their scheduled time" or something like that.&nbsp;</p></dd>
