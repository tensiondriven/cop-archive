  <dd><p>Wow. [@mention:455886150941203371],&nbsp;you really are&nbsp;the gift that keeps on giving! That video and the example of how you do behavioral agreements was huge for me (coming from the other thread about policies that try to limit people behavior. Full disclosure - I work with&nbsp;[@mention:577633875651499938]!). I hope it's okay with you that I've shared it with our "people" circle - sometimes "teal" thinking is tough to communicate and this was one of the best examples of it in practice that I've ever seen.</p><p>Not that we'll copy your ledger exactly per se, but you did a great job communicating the spirit of it. I hope we can come up with something in the same vein.</p><p>Thank you!</p></dd>
