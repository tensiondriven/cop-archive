  <dd><p>Hi! We do have something in the GlassFrog backlog to allow more refinement in breaking down domains, so thank you for sharing your thoughts - I'm definitely taking notes as Product Manager.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm curious in either of your experiences how often you update accountabilities in a way that you wouldn't want them to be updated on a role if they were linked somehow? I guess it would be a case where you've changed the accountability so much that it is no longer conceptually the same, or do you usually delete accountabilities in those cases?</p></dd>
