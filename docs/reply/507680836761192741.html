  <dd><p>This is very interesting, but how do you solve/reject the "i don't have the time to do this" objection ?</p><p>Let's take the example of a&nbsp;governance meeting&nbsp;where extending an&nbsp;accountability on a&nbsp;Required Role is necessary to solve a tension;&nbsp;while everyone around the table agrees that the accountability is to be added for the sake of the organization/circle,&nbsp;on which basis can you "prove" that the accountability must be done by a specific role, when the person filling the role is unwilling to comply ?</p><p>Of course, in this hypothetical case, finding a new role-filler is not an option&nbsp;(budget-wise) and nobody volunteers.</p></dd>
