  <dd><p>The reason for the current situation is that the service teams work well together as persons (the teams were originally put together on the basis of diversity of colour - Spiral Dynamic wise value systems). The problem is that circle structure for each team is a bit overkill, because they are replicating similar roles in each circle and that the roles&nbsp;are continuous requesting&nbsp;work from roles in another circle directly because going through the Lead Link is too slow&nbsp;in order to fulfill the kind of customer requests. So how to keep what works (diverse persons in a CS team with a coordinator and flexible handling of overflow) <em>and</em>&nbsp;supplementing that with clarity and roles in Holacracy. So I am thinking of multi filled roles with the idea of a policy that codifies&nbsp;the conditions for organizing the (people) teams? Call it a Customer Service Agents app. So any previous experiences or examples of policies welcome.&nbsp;</p></dd>
