  <dd><p>The distinction between "hard and clear" and "best judgement in&nbsp;a local context" helps! Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p>When you put "hard and clear" over&nbsp;"the best judgement of a partner filling a role" you risk to&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;the old management style like Al mentioned. Because of the wholeness of the human being and because we are working with tensions we have to be very carefull that a partner doesn't feel dependent of the leadlinks personal feelings and&nbsp;preferences. A good strategy is a great help in this, but not all organizatiosn have good strategies. What I try to say is that partners, like employees, can feel dependent of the leadlink when the leadlink interferes in prioritizing the work to many times. The old feeling of ranking&nbsp;(hierarchy) we are so used of can come back and the partner it will become harder for the partner&nbsp;using his / her wholeness to bring information into the system.</p><p>I hope you'll give me some reactions on my thoughts.</p><p>-Christel</p></dd>
