I don't know much about&nbsp;Forex brokers but let me give you one piece of my reflection re this subject. I do think such companies may succeed in adopting Holacracy because from my understanding Holacracy is neutral. These companies may, by using Holacracy, discover they have a purpose they just did not know... and also make even more money. All living beings, including Organizations, have got a purpose, what I like to call a *Raison d'ÃŠtre*, and this just only because of their existence.</p><p>Sometimes I like to dream and imagine what could happen if all companies become aware of their evolutionary purpose... and align to it <img alt="" class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>Best,</p><p>Bernard Marie</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi, Bernard!</p><p>I like what you're saying. Though, it doesn't&nbsp;necessarily mean that adopting Holacracy won't destroy the company itself. Or&nbsp;I can try to put it another way: could it be that the only purpose of some organisation is to not exist?</p><p>P.S. Or, perhaps, a company culturally isn't ready for Holacracy adoption, and if you never stop it will eventually go bankrupt?</p></dd>
