  <dd><p>[@mention:456449141667144364]. Given your example. You have sensed a tension and with this Proposal it would be solved. You can give examples that peers in other comparable organizations make $ 4M and that already two colleagues have left because of the salary levels in your organization. Then the reason to dismiss would be that it will not help you to better express your roles?&nbsp;</p><p>But what if I state that having a market conform level will show to the market&nbsp;that we are a well respected and&nbsp;&nbsp;firm organization that cares for his people. Then my roles are impacted and am I able to better express my roles.</p><p>In this way I have provided all the reasoning for a valid Proposal. That somebody may have an Objection from a financial point of view I understand. But still the Proposal will be valid. Agree?</p><p>So, any additional guidance or insights on when a Proposal is invalid would be appreciated.</p></dd>
