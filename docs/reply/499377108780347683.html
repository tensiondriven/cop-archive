  <dd><p>Koen, in our office (running holacratically 7 months and counting), it has been worth our time to take a few time-outs to talk collectively about how things are going. A few elements have been helpful to emphasize (and we've been lucky enough to have peers identify these for one another, rather than top down sharing):</p><p>1. Tactical and Governance are not the only meetings or discussion arenas available for staff - these are only 2 specific types of meetings. staff may&nbsp;use other time to noodle subjects to their&nbsp;heart's content,</p><p>2. the intention of Holacracy is to put structure around distributed leadership and bring healthy accountability to a healthy anarchy, simplifying rather than complicating life for everyone,</p><p>3. everyone shall take several turns practicing the roles of&nbsp;facilitator and secretary to get a solid feel for the process from all angles,</p><p>4. finally, using examples of how Holacracy solves specific requests staff had previously identified and made regarding transparency, clarity, authority, etc.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Ss</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
