  <dd><p>Hi Lisi, I have read the latest <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Holacracy-Constitution-v4.1.pdf%A0" title="Holacracy-Constitution-v4.1.pdf">Holacracy-Constitution-v4.1</a>&nbsp;again just to be sure. I don't&nbsp;believe there to be any&nbsp;contradiction and I think your policy is fine. In our business, I energise the Lead Link role in one circle, and I energise the Facilitator role in another, the same with many people in our business. We did this because we initially did not have enough qualified Facilitators. We have no policies for this either and have had no issues. &nbsp;</p><p>As soon as someone&nbsp;who is not a circle member gets elected to energise the Facilitator role, they become a core circle member. Please see&nbsp;ARTICLE V - Adoption Matters of the constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>Btw, for the policy to apply to all circles it will need to be established at the General Company Circle.&nbsp;</p><p>Regards</p><p>Cobus</p></dd>
