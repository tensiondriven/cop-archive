  <dd><p>Hi Jean-Luc</p><p>Funny you mention this topic, I read through the same passage yesterday; I was wonder if it's possible to give more than one "vote" during an election - it is not.</p><p>I can imagine the intention is to bring full transparency and participation. You cannot "hide" with your estimation nor can you deny to help the circle find an appropriate person for a role.</p><p>Integrative election is not a bad tool IMHO, but sometimes it feels awkward if you are accustomed to "democratic election".</p></dd>
