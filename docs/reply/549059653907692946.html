  <dd><p>Tyler, appreciate your feedback about this. &nbsp;Can you share what tensions it is causing&nbsp;when the circle doesn't show up as incomplete? &nbsp;And what kind of indication do you feel would be useful? &nbsp;Such a circle already shows the default roles as unfilled (white), which is some indication of it's new state.</p></dd>
