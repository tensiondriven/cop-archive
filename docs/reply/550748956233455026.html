  <dd><p>We are talking a lot about leaders at the University - a few weeks ago I wrote a paper about Public Sector Leadership - and I talked to a politician about Holacracy as a possible management system for urban development and he was very interested. I think that not only in private companies it could be a great model but also for politicians and the public sector - in special departments.</p></dd>
