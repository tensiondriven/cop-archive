  <dd><h3>I interpret the &nbsp;Constitution to disagree with you Jeffrey. It says one or more of the following:</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>1.1 Definition of a Role</h3><p>The Organization’s Partners will typically perform work for the Organization by acting in an explicitly defined Role. A<strong><em>“Role”</em></strong> is an organizational construct with a descriptive name and one or more of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>(a)</strong> a <strong><em>“Purpose”</em></strong>, which is a capacity, potential, or unrealizable goal that the Role will pursue or express on behalf of the Organization.</li><li><strong>(b)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Domains”</em></strong>, which are things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, on behalf of the Organization.</li><li><strong>(c)</strong> one or more <strong><em>“Accountabilities”</em></strong>, which are ongoing activities of the Organization that the Role will enact.</li></ul></dd>
