  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for you replies, and sorry for not having kept this up.</p><p>I was not probably clear in my context, so let me rephrase it differently. In fact my issue is the right understanding of the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art321" target="_blank">Section&nbsp;3.2.1</a>&nbsp;"...Finally, a Proposal is always valid regardless of the preceding criteria if it is made solely to help evolve the Circle’s Governance to more clearly reflect <strong>activity that is already happening</strong>, or to trigger a new election for any Elected Role."</p><p>At the Coach training, we talked about "grounded" tension. In other words, to be valid, a tension must reflect a reality + to be inside the Circle's purpose.
