  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>With the elements you gave, I would consider this objection as valid, coming from the LL.</p><p>Usually, what I've seen the most is that the issue is the role proposed as a whole. And the common solution I experienced during integration is the split of the purpose/accountabilities of that role into multiple roles (or into existing roles) so that the LL can find partners to fit in.</p><p>Does it help ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
