  <dd><p>I agree with Margaux, how dangerous can it really be to have them vote anyways?</p><p>Even if a newcomer votes randomly (and usually they are perfectly aware of that and have no reasons to orient the results in any specific way), if you explain to him that he will be able to change his vote and make a more informed decision after hearing the reasons behind other people's votes, you make him part of the process, you make him feel relevant right away.</p><p>Andrea.</p></dd>
