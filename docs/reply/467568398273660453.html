  <dd><p>Hi Margaux,</p><p>Great question! I know there are translations of the Constitution and other resources from H1. I did review the H1 website and found several items on the resources page but the only glossary I found on the web was in English.</p><p>As someone with limited vocabulary in other languages, I thought it would be fun, educational and useful, at least for me. For example, how would I say Tactical Meeting in Japanese?</p><p>I would personally love a grid with translations of the terms in multiple languages all in one place. If that already exists and I just didn't know where to look, please let me know and I will request it from the owner. If it does not, I'm willing to do the work to build it for the community.</p><p>I hope that clarifies my purpose a little.</p></dd>
