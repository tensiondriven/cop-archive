  <dd><p>Hey Dien,</p><p>just a quick additional comment on your first question:</p><p><strong>1. Objections with resource allocation as arguments, such as not enough time, or not enough people. &nbsp;Which test question will rule them out as invalid ? And how ?</strong></p><p>I found it really helpful to add the following coaching: Why are resources not an issue in Governance? If we allowed&nbsp;resource objections&nbsp;(that could include scarcity of resources, lack of competence to energize that role etc.) we would immediately start to build the organization around people and not around the work that's needed to best express the organizational purpose. With Governance we are trying to figure out what would ideally be needed. If we don't have the people to fill these roles, well that's our reality and it probably creates another tension. At least we have more transparency on what is needed and have the opportunity to process it...</p><p>cheers,</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
