  <dd><p>Gerald, I am so glad you are bringing this up. With limited hands on work in Europe I don't have much experience to draw on here.</p><p>However, my generic thought is that we need an "app" that could even map the existing regulations and structures into an organization via roles and policies. This could be the first step rather -- to write it down and translate.</p><p>Even unions are pretty new territory for us. So far my sense is that similar to laws, we can simply create governance that aligns to broader external requirements or&nbsp;needs, and the organization processes can only evolve as much as those regulations or laws would allow, but at least we would have the clarity in Governance about what those boundaries are.&nbsp;</p><p>From mapping the existing structures, perhaps the relationship and role of the works council could have a chance to incrementally evolve. I hope you will continue the conversation here...let us know what you do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
