  <dd><p>Hello Mikolaj,</p><p>As said, this is a resource allocation decision. Not governamental. To clarify a little more, e.g. in our company we have "Expense Centers", and we treat every Expense Center as a Domain. So, some Roles in our company has some specific Expense Center´s domains. Also, every Expense Center has a budget. And, of course, a policy, saying that the Role can only spend the amount budgeted.</p><p>In this way,&nbsp;the Role make the decisions for its Expense Center. If it is expensive or not, it´s up to the domain owner.</p></dd>
