  <dd><p>[@mention:456167666726491228]: we've got a feature request to allow un-assigning elected roles in GlassFrog, which might get you partially where you are looking for. I'll add a +1 for you. And as we experiment with this in our own People &amp; Partnership circle, I think we'll find out what kinds of things GlassFrog will need to do to support Holacracy 5, so thank you for posting what you're doing with it!</p></dd>
