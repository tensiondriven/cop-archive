  <dd><p>The Lead Link cannot energize roles themselves. However the person filling the Lead Link role can be assigned by the Lead Link to fill some roles within the circle and I would say that that's healthy because the Lead Link role only take 10% of a person's time (even less). &nbsp;It would be difficult to be assigned to the Lead Link role and not doing work within the circle.</p></dd>
