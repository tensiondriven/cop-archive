  <dd><p>@Flavio,</p><p>Back to your question on the first place and to add on the answers you received</p><p><em><strong>1) SLA (Service Level Agreement) - Is it possible to add a SLA on a role? E.g. a role&nbsp;has to reply e-mails within 24 hours from the receipt. ItÂ´s not that we want to put SLA on every role, but we have some SLAs with our clients, and we have to honor that. How to do this?</strong></em></p><p>You may use accountability for setting expectations like :</p><p>"Reporting gross revenue for licensed services delivered in any given month by the 15th of the following month"</p><p>Or&nbsp;"Replying client inquiries within 24 hours"</p><p>An accountability is defined in the Constitution as "... ongoing activities of the Org. that the Role will enact" Art. 1.1 - you may add constraints on the ongoing activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
