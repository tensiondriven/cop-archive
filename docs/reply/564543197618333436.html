  <dd><p>Guess you described the solution yourself. Explain people the correct rules, practice the correct rules and tensions will arise on current Governance. These tensions can then be handled during Governance meeting.</p><p>What also might help is to invite a Coach after, say a period of 3 months, to do an audit on the Governance records. This will help and you and the organisation better understand the do's and dont's.</p><p>Lots of wisdom on this challenging journey and remember. Always trust the process :-).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
