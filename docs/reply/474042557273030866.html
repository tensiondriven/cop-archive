  <dd><p>I would like to see the testing objections make it obvious which ones need to be tested because it would be easy for someone to think that you only need to pass one of the tests to be valid.</p><p>Also the meeting cards do not make it explicit how testing of objections work. I would like to see the meeting cards answer my questions that follow because it creates confusion when they don't.&nbsp;Who asks the testing questions? Who answers? &nbsp;Who gets to decide if it is acceptable to pass the test? The book made this clear but the cards don't.</p></dd>
