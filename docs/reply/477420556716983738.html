  <dd><p>We haven't found a need to track too explicitly as yet.&nbsp;Rather we use APs as a&nbsp;way to have structured conversations about capacity and where effort (attention) needs to go.</p><p>I am somewhat against keeping&nbsp;timesheets (for many reasons) so would be cautious about tracking APs as it may lead back to some of the same thinking that the mindset of working for time brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The only&nbsp;step we have taken in this direction is&nbsp;allowing (through a policy) the Delivery circle to self-allocate more APs based on work projected in our pipeline. We have a simple "Hiring Trigger" policy that triggers our hiring process if the allocated APs exceed the circle's actual capacity. At the moment each delivery team simply keeps a spreadsheet of allocated APs for each role and actual by person in role.&nbsp;I am writing a simple app that we will trial to track total APs for a person energising roles across circles (i.e. working outside a Delivery team).&nbsp;</p></dd>
