  <dd><p>Sounds very normal and expected for the early stage Rebecca, and I think allowing those time outs is a good move (although also being cautious about too many what-ifs is good - though some are fine). &nbsp;Sounds like you're balancing it well, and&nbsp;25% of governance time in time-outs feels about right...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Brian</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
