  <dd><p>hi Gerald,</p><p>Do you know/have experience with functional subgrouping? If not: google on SCT/functional subgrouping/Y. Agazarian.</p><p>Some of my (synnervate-)colleagues are highly trained&amp;skilled in facilitating/applying this and we use it to have a very personal/relational conversation with each other, in which the undercurrent (of unspoken assumptions, opinions, worries, etc. in the relational space) can surface.</p><p>The goal is to integrate different perspectives and resolve conflicts. In our case it helps us to adress the 'storming' fase of our development as a group/org. It gives us very intense conversations, not necesarily comfortable, but great depth.&nbsp;</p><p>SCT partners great with Holacracy for us: made from the same systemic/holistic worldview.</p></dd>
