<p>I think both ways can work depending on the organization and its culture. For some "old" organizations the holacracy way of working is so different for people that they really don't understand the "choice" they have. They only know the old way of working. It causes anxiety for people. In my opinion&nbsp;it is more elegant if the organization takes the&nbsp;anxiety for change seriously and learn from that.&nbsp;If this anxiety comes from a negative thought, we can test if the thought gets confirmed when brought into relation; Is this anxiety caused by a negative prediction, we can test if the prediction is based on facts, etc.</p><p>You will see that taking the anxiety seriously already gives space to people to open up for changes.</p><p>So my advice would be: slow down when you encounter a lot of anxiety.</p><p>-Christel</p>  </div>
