  <dd><p>Hey Rebecca - I think you're fine almost whatever you do here. &nbsp;There's nothing special about Tactical Meetings, and the constitution lets you change how they're conducted anyway, so you could always adopt a policy that makes your other project-focused meetings just a special "tactical meeting". &nbsp;And there's also no reason you can't use GlassFrog's tactical meeting interface to capture outputs from another meeting that's not officially a "tactical meeting". &nbsp;So, either way you're fine - this is safe ground to experiment on without much risk of causing any harm to your base Holacracy practice.</p></dd>
