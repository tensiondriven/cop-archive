  <dd><p>Hey Keely,</p><p>I guess your question is referring to the different spaces: role-ational space vs. relational space. Whereas Holacracy provides a great framework to&nbsp;solve tensions within&nbsp;role-space (eg creating clarity via governance etc.) and that definitely has a side-effect on how people show up (it feels to me as boost for personal development) it does not provide tools to address relational issues (e.g. I don't like to way you are talking to me as human being or how you criticize me ongoingly etc...).</p><p>In fact&nbsp;Holacracy does not and <em>is not meant to</em> support people in leading challenging conversations or providing feedback. It's focus is clearly on the organzational (role) space.&nbsp;Thus I see a strong need to build up individual skills in how we interact as human beings&nbsp;(may it be verbal aikido, non-violent communication, awareness practices or whatever feels appropriate and helpful...). I would typically&nbsp;integrate that in the&nbsp;process of transitioning an organization to Holacracy.</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
