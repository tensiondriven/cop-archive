The reason I am reflecting on this is that I am perceiving that, due to some funny traits of the human mind, &nbsp;there seems to be a strange trade-off between giving a clear identity to something and being able to spread it as a virus...&nbsp;<br />For some reason the stronger the identity of what you are proposing, the easier it is to get strong reactions to it that are purely emotional, especially from decision makers ("Not invented here" --&gt; therefore bad, "we are good and we will build &nbsp;our own model!" )<br />This is certainly the case for holacracy at the moment (speaking from a country that doesn't shine for "organizational obsolescence awareness")&nbsp;<br />I have no clear ideas about it yet, but if we could get people to experiment some "liberating approaches" in a sandbox without threatening their organizational mindset directly we could prepare them better for what's to come.</p><p>This doesn't mean that a switch of the organization model can be triggered bottom up, we all know why that will never happen, but it may help ease the transition at a personal level.&nbsp;</p></dd>
