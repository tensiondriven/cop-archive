  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Chris Cowan posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>I haven't read the book, but I'm intrigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding: "<strong>adoption:</strong> microstructures are small innovative habits that could prepare the road&nbsp;to an adoption of Holacracy especially in&nbsp;very traditional contexts for which the - Holacracy All at Once or Nothing- approach might be too much to digest."&nbsp;</p><p>I think there are some. I have been working in the <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/80577" target="_blank">Habit Support</a> role within H1 and have been thinking about this a lot. A few of the "microstructures" that I see (if I'm using that word correctly) are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Tactical and Governance Meetings (they are the core sub-system IMO)</li><li>Technology integration (glassfrog&nbsp;usage/comfort, referencing roles in internal electronic communications/systems)&nbsp;</li><li>Personal processing: Projects vs. next-actions, etc. Duties to each other. (this can be delayed until after the core sub-systems have stabilized)</li></ul><p>So, these are just top-of-head examples.</p><p>Regarding these sub-systems, I think of the quote from Animal Farm, "all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others." That is, everything in the Constitution is needed, but some are more needed than others.&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>Thanks [@mention:455886150941203371], I am particularly interested in the adoption matters. The reason I am reflecting on this is that I am perceiving that, due to some funny traits of the human mind, &nbsp;there seems to be a strange trade-off between giving a clear identity to something and being able to spread it as a virus...&nbsp;<br />For some reason the stronger the identity of what you are proposing, the easier it is to get strong reactions to it that are purely emotional, especially from decision makers ("Not invented here" --&gt; therefore bad, "we are good and we will build &nbsp;our own model!" )<br />This is certainly the case for holacracy at the moment (speaking from a country that doesn't shine for "organizational obsolescence awareness")&nbsp;<br />I have no clear ideas about it yet, but if we could get people to experiment some "liberating approaches" in a sandbox without threatening their organizational mindset directly we could prepare them better for what's to come.</p><p>This doesn't mean that a switch of the organization model can be triggered bottom up, we all know why that will never happen, but it may help ease the transition at a personal level.&nbsp;</p></dd>
