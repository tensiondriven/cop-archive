  <dd><p>I fully agree with Brian's comments and I would add that one of the key success factors, if not the most important, is that the CEO masters the use of Holacracy in all its nuances as quickly as possible to deal with all the tensions he senses in relation to the needs of the organization he is able to detect, both to serve the company better (and the use of Holacracy gives him much more power over the organization than he had before) and to model by example and thus allow all other employees of its company to dare to treat using Holacracy's power all the tensions/needs of the organization that they are able to identify.</p></dd>
