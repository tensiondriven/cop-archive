  <dd><p>Both the Lead Link and Rep Link can do the updates - no need to check with the role before. If none of them have informations, they can say “no update” and they'll come with updates once they have them (during a tactical meeting of the sub circle for instance) :</p><ul><li><strong>4.2.3 (d) Progress Updates:</strong>&nbsp;During this step, the Facilitator asks each participant to highlight progress towards achieving any Project or expressing any Accountability of any of the participant’s Roles in the Circle. Participants may only share progress made since the last report given, and not the general status of a Project or Accountability. Each participant may decide which Projects or Accountabilities are worth reporting on, however if another Circle Member explicitly requested updates on a specific Project, that one must be included until it’s either completed or dropped. F<strong>or progress updates about a Project or Accountability of a Sub-Circle, the Facilitator must allow both the Lead Link and Rep Link of the Sub-Circle the opportunity to share updates.</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And accountability on the Rep Link for “Providing visibility to the Super-Circle into the health of the Sub-Circle, including reporting on any metrics or checklist items assigned to the whole Sub-Circle”.</p></dd>
