  <dd><p>Some people can work alone without issues (myself for example, I just need to put music in my headphones, and can work alone with only emails/chat interactions if needed in addition to weekly meetings), so I feel like it depends more on the type of character of the person and its conditions for working. After, it's sure that for brainstorming, getting new ideas or “foolish concepts”, interactions are needed, and I believe in our company Margaux, we have two chances: The retreats, along the possibilities to work on clients for a couple weeks together (so you basically get lots of informal interactions, allowing easy brainstorm).</p><p>As for your last message, curious to know in which context you're talking? Yours, or a generic one, or just as example?</p></dd>
