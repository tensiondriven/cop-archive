  <dd><p>What is the general aim of those who resist autonomy and distributed authority? If we can answer that question, then I think there is plenty of evidence for developing answers that for your question. It seems to me that the command, control, and predict mindset can be influenced by MorningStarâ€™s success. That it is possible cannot be denied. From there, that it is possible in this organization and what that could look like make sense. I also think the 100% in part of the company makes sense as a starting point for easing a company into Holacracy. I've also started researching the LS website and love a lot of what I see there...thank you for sharing that resource!&nbsp;</p></dd>
