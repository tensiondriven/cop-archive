  <dd><p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are 4 goals to the tactical meeting, all explained in the section 4.2.1 of the constitution:</p><h4>4.2.1 Focus &amp; Intent</h4><p>Tactical Meetings are for:</p><ul><li><strong>(a)</strong> sharing the completion status of recurring actions on checklists owned by the Circle’s Roles;</li><li><strong>(b)</strong> sharing regular metrics assigned to the Circle’s Roles to report;</li><li><strong>(c)</strong> sharing progress updates about Projects and other work owned by the Circle’s Roles; and</li><li><strong>(d)</strong> triaging Tensions limiting the Circle’s Roles into Next-Actions, Projects, or other outputs that help reduce those Tensions.</li></ul><h4>&nbsp;</h4><p>I would add an implicite one on top of that which is that the tactical meeting allows you to play with&nbsp;role-ationships. It puts lots of clarity on authorities and help identify any “racket hole” / missing part of the governance. Of course you do that on a day-to-day basis but with the tactical meeting, you are sure not to miss any governance/evolution opportunity for the organization.</p></dd>
