  <dd><p>So today, we had yet another great session with&nbsp;[@mention:548355922639373031],&nbsp;[@mention:534281552617879089]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:474746343788652082].

Being on-line takes it to a whole new level where you can't use your presence and body language to redirect attention to the proper person.

On reflection I see it's probably best to include the option of the time-out in the initial facilitation framing so that people can ask question if they really need to and focus on&nbsp;showing&nbsp;them what they&nbsp;can do&nbsp;and what are their pathways in the current situation. So that to get a good mix of supporting good meeting habits and teaching&nbsp;Holacracy rules in a way not to overwhelm them during a meeting nor to loose it's momentum but still get the message across.</p><p>Thanks!</p></dd>
