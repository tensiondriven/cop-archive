  <dd><p>@Fajar, I have my way of understanding your problem which may be right... don't take this as final, because I'm not a coach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally Lead Links would not interfere on the Roles domain decisions, but in the other hand the Circle can define Policies that specify that Roles should obey to the Lead Link defined common practices or even that Roles need to consult the Lead Link or that the Lead Link can take decisions on Roles' domains. It all depends on your company needs and practices. Circle Policies are there for you to customize things to your needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, it would be nice to have this confirmed. In any case, if you'll have an answer out of a closed environment, please be sure to let us know here. Thanks!</p></dd>
