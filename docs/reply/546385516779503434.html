  <dd><p>To define them in "holacratic" terms they could be referred to as alternative participatory meeting structures to be practiced in groups &nbsp;that are usually larger than your average circle size, with the purpose of finding ideas or solving big challenges together.&nbsp;</p><p>They could be used in holacracy trainings (and I would say some already are), so&nbsp;&nbsp;when some trainer holds a PCT they could use some of them to engage people in reflections, comments and FAQ</p><p>They could be used before the adoptions, inside a target company, &nbsp;as an integration to old fashioned structures, &nbsp;to awaken the sense of responsibility and authority, the personal voice that everyone needs to bring &nbsp;to an holacracy implementation, enabling some mindshift at the personal level. Something that prepares the table for what comes next.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
