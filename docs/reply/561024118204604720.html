  <dd><p>Hello all,</p><p>I have read the above discussion with interest: I regular encounter clients with the <strong>need&nbsp;to record a decision or piece of information</strong>, because it holds a certain formal status. Example: "Customer X has agreed to delivery on July 1st."</p><p>Such information needs to be known by the full team, and all team members need to be able to find this information somewhere (and if applicable,&nbsp;auditors will require this too).&nbsp;</p><p>In the above, I see no practical solution to logging this. So far, we have suggested two options to clients:</p><ol><li><strong>Logging as notes</strong> ('Important notes/decisions')</li><li><strong>Logging as 'actions'</strong> and highlighting it is a decision/note: (Secretary -&nbsp;NOTE: client X has agreed to delivery July 1st)</li></ol><p>Has anyone encountered similar questions and what solutions were tried? Looking forward to hearing your findings.&nbsp;</p></dd>
