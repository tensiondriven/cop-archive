  <dd><p>For anyone keen to know more about liberating structures, much like holacracy (and the people like all of you keen to generously share) the website is superb: <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com" target="_blank">www.liberatingstructures.com</a> The material is available on the creative commons, anyone is welcome to use the structures. The structures are intended to unleash the collective intelligence of a group - more voices are heard, possibilities are unlocked. Each liberating structure has a clearly stated purpose, so it's fun to shop around and see which purpose best fits one's challenges or stuckness. Hope this is helpful.</p></dd>
