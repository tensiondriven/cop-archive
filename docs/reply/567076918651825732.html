  <dd><p>Hi Ray - we do this all the time and it doesn't seem to cause us any issues! Does it cause a problem for you to have this cross-circle reference in your governance?</p><p>EG I could say "liaising with Sales&nbsp;[a circle]" - but when there is actually a specific role in Sales, why not be more specific? And also GlassFrog doesn't&nbsp;@&nbsp;link to circles, only to roles - so it makes governance records easier to use.</p></dd>
