  <dd><p>Thanks Dien and Chris - I have some kick-ass material to give to the Rep Link, I have really been working on this using all the stuff from coach training and before. I'll share the results after&nbsp;it gets considered.</p><p>Re: my ability to object/not at the time&lt; i admit my own desire to get some sort of accomplishment in the right direction, a finite human ability to manage multiple roles and altitudes simultaneously, and a participant voicing dissatisfaction with the governance process during process timeout (why can't I ask clarifying questions after an amendment as long as I don't share reaction?) outweighed my ability to consider what might be NVGO in the space.</p></dd>
