  <dd><p>My short answer is, "yes," you are correct that by default the Lead Link defines the metrics for their Circle. A role within the circle could suggest a new metric to the Lead Link, but officially the Lead Link owns the decision for which metrics are reported.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Metrics assigned to a sub-circle are defined by the super-circle's Lead Link, because a sub-circle is treated just like any other role from the super-circle's perspective. So, it's really the same answer as above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does that answer your question? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
