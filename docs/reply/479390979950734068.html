  <dd><p>So, on further review, all views of Projects in GlassFrog allow linking to your system. The paperclip at the top of the summary view isn't as obvious as it could be. Perhaps allowing and displaying in the same type of way as +notes in the Role view will help others figure out and take advantage of this feature.&nbsp;</p></dd>
