  <dd><p>@Carrie, you could argue as well, that it's not in the accountabilities of the direct Lead Link of that&nbsp;role to decide about the resources that are spent to energize that role.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the Lead Link's accountabilities is: "Allocating the Circle’s resources".</p><p>In my opinion that means "Allocating/Distributing the Circle’s <strong>given</strong> resources", where the #FTEs might be one of these resources. But that Lead Link cannot decide about the "quantity" of the given resources, i.e. he cannot influence the #FTEs that is allocated to his Circle.</p><p>So, whatever process is in place to define a Circle's resources, that process needs to be followed in order to determine if it's OK&nbsp;to reduce the #FTE for that circle. Or maybe find a third way, so that the respective circle can still fulfil its accountabilities while still being able to reduce the time your colleague spends on that specific role.</p></dd>
