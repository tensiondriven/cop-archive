  <dd><p>Thanks for the suggestion Jeff - Tbh I'd struggle a little with a list like this. It feels somehow impersonal. I already know what values I started the organisation with so finding the values is not really the issue. I can feel them in my stomach!&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" title=";)" /></p><p>I have two slightly different problems.</p><p>1. How does one integrate an already existing set of values into an organisation running Holacracy or any sort of distributed management.</p><p>2. How to translate what can sometimes be nebulous values into real meaningful actions so that as an organisation you can endeavour to be what you say you are in the world. This problem has been there for me since I founded the organisation. Chris talks at length and with great insight about this problem amongst others in this thread.</p></dd>
