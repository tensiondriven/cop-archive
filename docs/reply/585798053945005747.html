  <dd><p>Hi Margaux,</p><p>I feel there are 2 needs in your message : having people/noise around you ("life" :-)) and also being able to interact more often/differently with your partners.</p><p>Facing that issue with "work@home"&nbsp;in my company, the current "solution" is usually the co-working places : you get "noise", people, and good conditions to work (might be missing at home). And because it's a melting-pot of different businesses, can creates some opportunities too !</p><p>Personally I can "live" working&nbsp;at&nbsp;distance with my colleagues, but cannot stand being alone for long.</p><p>I don't have issue working with my colleague on skype, and meet them from time to time (your retreats)</p><p>In my humble opinion : You wonder if it's possible to work remotely : Yes, alone : Not for long (but does not have to be your partners).</p><p>But that's only my personal view.</p><p>Hope it helps :-)</p></dd>
