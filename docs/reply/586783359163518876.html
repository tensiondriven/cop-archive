  <dd><p>Hi Cathy</p><p>We managed to re-certify our ISO9001-cerfiticate after one year of pure holacracy-practice. We could even manage to get ISO27001 information security certification which is much harder.</p><p>Also as Luca mentioned showing all the roles, circles and their accountabilites help a lot. For the rest we could show at the audit that people following the defined processes in the management system (as before Holacracy).</p><p>The approach was to take our "old" management-system and forge it to one that was lead by the spirit and rules of Holacracy. We&nbsp;tried not to get into a&nbsp;situation with two "systems" beeing incompatible or worse fighting each other</p><p>So far it went well - although a complete fusion will take years i suppose because the character of the two systems is completely different...</p></dd>
