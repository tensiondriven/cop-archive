  <dd><p>Hi Rebecca,</p><p>Thanks for sharing this open heart written post.</p><p>I've had similar experience on my own too, enacting the same facilitator role and felt very very hard on all of us too sometimes.</p><p>As I've just discovered your&nbsp;"old" post, I'm curious to know what would be your view today, with a couple of months experience. All alive ? Smiling ?</p><p>How did you manage it all ???</p><p>I'm at the point where I'm going to start the same "first step" for the fourth&nbsp;implementation next Tuesday, within a brand new organization in this case, so I'm still scared of it, scared of how I can give my best, strictly respecting the process on one side, without loosing the harmony of our wonderful group, especially as our first meetings went very well so far, in a very efficient way.</p><p>Cheers</p></dd>
