  <dd><p>Thus far, nobody has questioned the existence of the Circle at all. The Circle has a lot of full-time people doing a TON of very valuable work. My question, based on many of the responses we get on this topic, is why everyone thinks the Lead Link is so necessary? Obviously, they are built in for a very important reason, they are typically the person that holds it all together, and in most cases, they are needed.</p><p>However, if the work is getting done either way and everyone on the team knows what is happening and is aligned on the direction the Circle needs to go, is the Lead Link really necessary? So far, we are proving that to not be the case. Of course, if it fails miserably, we'll find out together!</p></dd>
