  <dd><p>Hi Friedrich,</p><p>Most interesting question.</p><p>From my perspective, you have to :</p><ul><li>design an app&nbsp; describing the firing process,</li><li>then to adopt this "Firing" app through a policy in a gov meeting of the general circle.</li></ul><p>This app has to be designed by a role (HR) accountable for that.</p><p>II've seen a such app once, but I don't find it in the Holacracy Appstore. The main idea was to have a comitee with 3 roles (advocate, lead link, and ?) deciding of firing or not the person.</p><p>One important point - and the first one - from my perspective : firing someone means that that person does not hold any role in the organization. So before this last end, the escalation scenario could be :<br />• taking somebody out of a role (lead link decision)<br />• reallocating the person to another role (lead link decision + reallocating talents process)<br />• if the person does not fit any role, firing process</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
