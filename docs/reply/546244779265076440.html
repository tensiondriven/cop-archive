  <dd><p>Hi Hansjuerg,</p><p>Adding to the comments above: if you think that this specific constitutional rule of Lead Link accepting projects for absent circle members is reproducing shadow power structures, worst case you might also think of changing this "default" setting via a policy. But I guess that a joint reflection&nbsp;among circle members to reflect on dynamics experienced fostering/hindering a transition to Holacracy would be a smarter first move.</p><p>We did similar exercises with clients and made good experiences with tracking outputs in a public "Implementation Impediment Backlog" (with three columns: identified, work in progress, solved). Surfacing them raises a different level of collective awareness and helps to break often implicit/unconscious patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>- Gerald</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
