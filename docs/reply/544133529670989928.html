There are however specific values, rights and duties each member of an organization is bound to when applying Holacracy, and these &nbsp;may make specific type of personalities and personal goals more or less compatibile with the system (or they may even contribute &nbsp;to a reshape of an initial profile into a different one after applying &nbsp;the rules of holacracy for a while --&gt; producing the so called "mindshift" ). Is this the direction in which your study is going?&nbsp;</p><p>(have a look at Belbin team roles, for complementary&nbsp;ways of subdividing personal needs/profiles in teamwork)</p><p>PS: good to see an increase of academic interest &nbsp;in Italy, I believe you are in good company (I've heard a thesis on Holacracy from the Università del Piemonte Orientale is also undergoing finalization)</p></div></blockquote><p>Thank you for your answer, this is exactly what we are studing.</p><p>Can you suggest us some documents to look for more information?
