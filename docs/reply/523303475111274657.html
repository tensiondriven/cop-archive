  <dd><p>Hi Keith,&nbsp;</p><p>I checked with our GlassFrog team, and here's what I gather: to the best of their knowledge,&nbsp;there has never been a default domain for “All functions and activities for this organization” for the anchor circle. It has always used “All functions and activities for this circle”. &nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p></dd>
