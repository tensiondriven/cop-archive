  <dd><p>Interesting, never thought about it, but I &nbsp;think it is coherent with the the fact that the "what do YOU&nbsp;need?" question in tactical is phrased that way and not as "Which role of yours needs what?". &nbsp;Loggin the tension personally allows you to make the most basic distinction between operational and organizational stuff: " I need to be able to expect that someone does xyz".You log the tension in its most raw-state and go on&nbsp;with the tactical without getting into details that can be later refined in governance. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
