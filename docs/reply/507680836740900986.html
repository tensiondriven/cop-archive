My original intention was to discuss ways to make the async process work better in itself, perhaps by leveraging a tool like Slack. This is more of an experiment that likely a smaller sub-circle would use, not a means to replace any existing hola-operations.</p></div></blockquote><p>We have a policy in our circle saying that whenever somebody posts an async proposal to slack with channel notification, everyone should object within 72 hours, otherwise the proposal is accepted. It was used a few times during last few months. Works great for small and easy proposals. The problem is we actually have to wait for these 72 hours, because&nbsp;usually there's somebody who&nbsp;doesn't react to the proposal in any way.</p>  </div>
