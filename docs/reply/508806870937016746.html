  <dd><p>Yo, Xavier!</p><p>You can definitely bring that up to let them know. In my opinion, I would do the checklist as normal (just so they get the information they need) and in Triage, bring up an agenda item regarding the Checklist and inform them it is more of a Metric. They are providing valuable information, not just saying "check" or "no check" to something.</p><p>As for removing it, anyone can propose to remove a Checklist item. If you remove it and add it as a metric instead (providing the Lead Link is cool with it, since they add metrics), I can't imagine anyone would care, as they would still get the same information they need, just in a different round.</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p></dd>
