  <dd><p>Wow, so many answers, thank you!!&nbsp;</p><p>[@mention:550889693724425252]&nbsp;Thank you for sharing your experience. When I say a co-working space is a waste of money, it is just when it is not shared between people of the same company. I can see from&nbsp;[@mention:490932114704493598]'s comment that it can generate leads but we don't all have sales roles and it makes more sense to capitalize, as a company, on interactions between partners of the same company - would be different for an independant I guess.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;[@mention:581434538543771509]&nbsp;for reminding me of the different interaction styles. I can fully understand that and at the same time, the company has some needs we need to cover even if the person prefers to work alone in a silent environment. It is a question of survival.</p><p>I don't know if my mind is stuck or whatever... My current thinking is that we need on-site human interactions to run a company and take it to the next level - no matter the way people prefers to work given their interaction styles. And the more we have that type of interactions, the better. Every once in a while is not sufficient IMO but I guess it depends on the personality... Arg, so complicated...</p></dd>
