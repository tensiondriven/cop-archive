  <dd><p>Hi Alexey,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a Facilitator,&nbsp;I would try to test it with “Is that a reason it causes harm or move us backwards or is it just that you don't personally like it?”</p><p>Either it is just a personal concern and the person says option 2 or if it does really cause harm, “ok how does it cause harm?”.</p><p>If the person says that it is because she won't be able to energize it, that's a different issue and maybe it is not the appropriate role to put this in or maybe it is just a assignment concern and has nothing to do in governance, depends on what the person says.</p><p>In conclusion, I'd say that the Facilitator has to seek the reason why it causes harm, he has to dig a bit. He is not just asking for an objection, he seeks a real reason, while still not judging the reason but the person has to provide a reason why it causes harm. With no reason, you don't have any objection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p></dd>
