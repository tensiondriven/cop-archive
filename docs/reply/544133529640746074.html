  <dd><p>Hi Selen,&nbsp;</p><p>Here are two&nbsp;pointers, some of which I also mentioned in our conversation:<br /><br />The Concept of Creative Tension, as described in Peter Senge's "The Fifth Discipline". <a href="http://www.productiveflourishing.com/a-users-guide-to-creative-tension/" target="_blank">This article</a> provides a nice intro and some pointers to further reading materials.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">Cognitive dissonance</a>, a&nbsp;concept from psychology, could provide some good starting points. The wikipedia article also refers to some alternative theories.</p><p>This is very interesting topic and I'm curious to learn more about what you discover in your research.</p><p>Best, Patrick</p></dd>
