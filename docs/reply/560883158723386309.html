  <dd><p>Thanks all, for your encouraging responses!</p><p>Currently, the prototype is quite an elaborate set-up of board pieces laser-cut from baltic plywood and close to eighty die-cut cards with rounded corners. That is to say, the exhibition setup-version of v.3.0 is not the easiest to mass-manufacture and distribute – at the moment.</p><p>My intent going forward is to team up, co-develop and distribute the game further with validation of inclusions made with certified Holacracy providers. In the meantime, the game’s elements might need to be put on US letter-sized / ISO A4 sheets for interested parties to print and cut out themselves. This might also help get more data on the game as it needs further play-testing.</p><p>[@mention:499799321313210508], [@mention:534281552617879089],&nbsp;[@mention:456167666726491228]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353]: is that something that you would be interested in?</p></dd>
