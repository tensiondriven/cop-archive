  <dd><p>HI Michael,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a testimonial video of the CEO of a marketing agency called Human to Human, based in Paris:&nbsp;<a href="https://igipartners.com/en/interview-jerome-delaveau" target="_blank">https://igipartners.com/en/interview-jerome-delaveau</a></p><p>They've changed the concept of account manager and clarified the different roles needed. Some people would fill all the roles that previously made an “account manager” and other who were not good at some stuff, were not assigned to all the roles. Holacracy allows that flexibility. Otherwise, you always have to look for the perfect profile able to do everything.</p><p>Hope that helps <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
