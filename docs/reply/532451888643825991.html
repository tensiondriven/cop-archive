  <dd><p>I agree, but it's not something that is constitutionally requested if I understand it correctly, as objection testing seems only to be restricted to governance meetings.</p><p>Now I can&nbsp;of course make governance proposals to extend objection testings to other situations&nbsp;in our company.</p><p>The question is: would&nbsp;it make sense to be&nbsp;constitutionally requested? At least for domain impact objections, as this is the only mention of "objections" outside governance in the constitution.</p></dd>
