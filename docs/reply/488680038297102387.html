  <dd><p>@Brian - Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I think your suggestions regarding Strategies and whole-circle ownership are both things we have done a good job of using informally but a bad job of formalizing and making clear.&nbsp; That deficiency probably makes the process less repeatable and harder to learn from.&nbsp; We'll have to see what we can do.</p></dd>
