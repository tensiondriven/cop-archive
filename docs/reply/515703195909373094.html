  <dd><p>LIUYAN -- still trying to get them onto the CoP. For some reason I cannot upload PDFs. Once I get that figured out, I'll post them in a separate thread. They will also be made available on the web. Not sure when that will happen, but hopefully soon. If that happens quickly, then I'll make a post with those links instead of the PDFs.</p></dd>
