  <dd><p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>I have implemented Attention Points at one of our clients.</p><p>One of the things it creates is an internal "Supply &amp; Demand" of attention (or in simple words time). For which the Points are its currency to exchange attention.</p><p>I could definitely see a similar way to do budgets. You allocate "Budget points" (you might just call them Euro's) circles and roles. Which is for them just like attention points a resource to spend within the role.</p><p>Its definitely one way to do budgetting. It is kind of a cheque for each circle/ role to spend on what they find important for their role up to their max "Budget points".</p><p>You could then define some auxiliary processes/policies that add a bit of alignment between points spenders if you need for larger amounts of descretionary spending.</p><p>Hope this helps,</p><p>Koen</p></dd>
