  <dd><p>&nbsp;Ciao Marco,</p><p>I ask for updates by person and let each person speak, I usually don't read projects one by one but if I did I wouldn't make distinctions &nbsp;by status ( I.e: a project moved to "done" during the week may still make it &nbsp;worth reporting on the delta that brought it there) every once in a while I remind participants that they have the right to ask for updates on projects they are interested in even those that they know exist but are not tracked (yet). Before moving to the next person I usually ask the current speaker if he wants to make any project status changes.</p></dd>
