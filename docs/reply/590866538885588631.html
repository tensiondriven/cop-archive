  <dd><p>Maybe my idea is naive too, but as a Lead Link, can't you just have a good talk to members of the circle which don't "obey" the strategy ("As a Lead Link I doubt your role fit is good since you lack to follow the strategy").&nbsp;</p><p>A bit harsh perhaps, but in the end the Lead Link should guide all circle members to pursuit the circles purpose.</p><p>Btw, in most circles I participate the Lead Link sets strategies together with all circle members to sense tensions and to increase acceptance (team effort instead of one man / woman show). Works well&nbsp;</p></dd>
