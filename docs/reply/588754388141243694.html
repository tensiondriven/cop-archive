  <dd><p>I recognize that the condition&nbsp;that&nbsp;the duties of 4.1 only apply to members is quite often overlooked. The reason&nbsp;i think is that&nbsp;teams and people are not used to managing circle or role boundaries. However I have experienced that&nbsp;organizations with several circles, holding that boundary is fundamental for attaining clarity on what requests you should be&nbsp;prioritizing, just as it is essential to be conscious of what is in your role and when you taking on a project as individual action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
