  <dd><p>[@mention:551030431173357846] we are around 100+ employees, mostly virtual, and geographically dispersed. One practice a few of our circles have adapted is a policy in the Tactical Meeting Check-in to discuss "Personal and Business Bests" with cross-talk allowed. This seems to work well -- partners can talk about their week, business highlights, their weekend, or other fun activities. This also warms up the meeting. Others can comment and ask questions.</p><p>The only downside is it can add time to the meeting and potentially take away time to process tensions. In one circle, we limited it to 30 seconds (not really timed), but just so someone doesn't go on and on forever and we can get to the real reason we're having the meeting.</p></dd>
