  <dd><p>Ha ha ha! Damn - that's not the answer I was expecting! I can definitely imagine that being a tension of yours&nbsp; :-)</p><p>OK - if you have any useful thoughts on the process I'd love to hear them but otherwise I'll plough on blindly for now. I know what I'm trying to get at and I'm reasonably sure it's important at least for our kind of organisation. It's just how to fit the process inside an organisation that is grasping for a more distributed leadership that I haven't quite fathomed out yet. Either way, all of the thoughts above have been really useful on that journey.</p></dd>
