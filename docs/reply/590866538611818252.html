  <dd><p>[@mention:590725801077679128]&nbsp;For-profit Holacracy company is not different in that matter. Profit is an expresion of a successful serving to&nbsp;the customers outside of the company in the enviroment/market in which company operates. Profit is a must-have.</p><p>As shareholders are stakeholders, as such its a role which has&nbsp;its own expectations on&nbsp;a company, that said it could be and usualy is return on investment. I find it totaly ok to make that expectation explicit to the general company circle, so that it can align to it as to other expectations e.g. social responsibility.</p><p>If you have any more specific question, would be glad to discuss it further.</p><p>P.S.: I am a shareholder and a "regular" partner of our org. filling lots of roles. If org. will not fulfill my expectations on ROI, I might consider withdrawing my capital out of it, but still staying as a regular partner. I fill about it as an old way of thinking, and would like to transition some time to model of all partner = shareholders = profit is what you get for your work, I think H1 has model like this and Encode.</p></dd>
