  <dd><p>Hi Angela,</p><p>Thank you for your comment, and sorry for my late reply.</p><p>If I can paraphrase your motivation to implement Holacracy, it sounds like you were trying to vaccinate your organization against cancerous infection from external stakeholders that might not share your vision. Is that a fair re-statement?</p><p>I'm curious. What leadership qualities are you looking to develop? Do you see&nbsp;these qualities as still compatible with using Holacracy in your organization?</p></dd>
