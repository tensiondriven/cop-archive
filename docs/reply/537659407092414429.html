  <dd><p>As a nonprofit college our hiring considerations include the liability associated with hiring and firing. Our local laws make it best for us to recommend hiring and firing to the Board of Trustees. The Board cannot be sued for hiring and firing decisions. So, we have a faculty Circle that raises the tension of needing more faculty to the GCC lead link, who is technically the board's sole employee. The GCC lead link then relays The Faculty circleâ€™s recommendation for hiring or firing to the board.&nbsp;</p></dd>
