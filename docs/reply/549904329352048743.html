  <dd><p>Another approach might be to just cut out some steps.&nbsp; What if the Project Manager reached out directly to LL or RL of Level 2, or to LL or another role within Level 1, asking if they sensed the same tension and would be willing to act on it in Level 1 governance?&nbsp; I suggest this not as an attempt to cut out or undermine RL of Level 3, but just to accelerate the process -- particularly where the individuals likely know each other, sense the tensions, etc.</p></dd>
