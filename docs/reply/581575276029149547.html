<p>Great topic - we've still got a mish-mash between the two 'styles' described here, with growing emphasis on non-action / non-'directive' (to use your term) purpose statements.</p><p>The way we've been framing this internally is along the lines of a Mission Statement, which has Vision&nbsp;+ Action = Mission, as something we often work on in our organization's personal growth workshops and peer support groups.</p><p>Vision = the way I wish the world would be<br />Action = the things I will do to work towards that</p><p>Holacratically, then the adaptation is:</p><p>Purpose = the way the org / circle would be if this Role was fully expressed<br />Accountabilities&nbsp;= the recurring actions the Role takes in pursuit of that end state</p><p>We have found the differentiation to be very helpful in providing role clarity and dilineating a 'reason for being' from 'what I do'.</p>  </div>
