  <dd><p>Thank you&nbsp;[@mention:476716727608952329],&nbsp;</p><p>I like that you mention the trick is to have commitment to deal with tough stuff and the process that brings it on. Holacracy, in my opinion , is really align with this. So after the tough stuff is brought upon and settled with role creation, the issue is gone, and we don't need to deal with this again whenever similar scenario arise right?</p><p>I guess to be more direct to the point, my follow up question would be, is it okay (common) for role filler to held a brainstorming session to reach a particular decision that's his accountability? In such session, invitee will be passionate about their opinion and what they thing is best, but we still let the role filler to make the final call (decision)?</p></dd>
