And afterwards creating more clarity on what "functions" of leadership do now reside within the system (typically people management aspects) and which elements of the work are still needed (typically a set of smaller roles - such as investor management, spokesperson, etc.).

I observed the switch of a CEO who got used to focus his job on delegating and asking the question "who takes care of that?". When he recognized that this is operational work to be done, where actually he is the best fit, it was a big thing for him. He came back with the work done by next morning and felt really proud of what he brought forward. At that point he learned to take on roles that do real work for the organization and he was very happy about that.</p><p>- Gerald</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
