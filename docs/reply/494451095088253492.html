  <dd><p>To echo something Karilen said and expand slightly:&nbsp; I think it's far better to have a policy that you think is questionable -- and perhaps designed only for your period of transition -- than to have a tacit understanding that people will/should ask permission but fail to codify that understanding in governance.&nbsp; In my experience, codification of old policies was a necessary step toward changing them to something that more closely fits the Holacratic paradigm because it gets them out in the open, providing a shared understanding of the current situation and the change.</p></dd>
