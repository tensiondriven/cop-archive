  <dd><p>I am not sure I fully get your question, Jürgen.</p><p>The "Anchor" Circle is a Circle defined by the Holacracy Constitution: It is the "first", the "highest" Circle.</p><p>A "General" Circle is not defined by the Holacracy&nbsp;Constitution. However, many Holacracy-powered companies have a "General Company Circle" (GCC) as a Subcircle to the Anchor Circle. (<a href="http://glassfrog.holacracy.org/organizations/5" target="_blank">HolacracyOne does this, see here.</a>&nbsp;At Structure &amp;&nbsp;Process, <a href="http://structureprocess.com/blog/holacracy-alltag-praxis/" target="_blank">we used to do this, but got rid of it, see here</a>.)</p><p>If you find that your Anchor Circle is crowded up with too many roles, creating a "Company" (or "Operations", or "GCC", whatever works in your context)-Subcircle might be a good first step.</p><p>Does this help?&nbsp;</p></dd>
