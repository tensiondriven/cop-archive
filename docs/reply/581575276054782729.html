  <dd><p>We are working through this in our non-profit.&nbsp; How to allocate resoruces to circles (i.e. is it a lump sum for a quarter or on a project by project basis). What activities are part of our monthly burn rate and what are outside of it and "discretionary".&nbsp; Who decides on discretionary spending and at what thresholds.&nbsp; Does the lead link of a circle control internal budgets or are they assigned by a central financial role.&nbsp; &nbsp; I guess I would be surprised if the Holacracy folks had any input aroudn this beyond "this is how we do it" becuase I imagine (perhaps naively) that this structure will be unique to the roles and structures we all build inside of our own organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For us--we are working towards having audited financial statements as an aspirational goal and have an accountant helping us to build systems that match our development and stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[@mention:454478741268114544]--do my additional questions (no answers unfortunately) resonate with you?&nbsp;</p></dd>
