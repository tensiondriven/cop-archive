  <dd><p>I wonder why you are debating this,and not processing it in Governance or Tactical just like anything else: If anyone has a tension about the circle structure, they can take action. The process ensures that this is safe.&nbsp;</p><p>There seem to be all kinds of different tensions at play here, and a lot of groupthink. The circle would probably benefit from more individual tension processing rather than consensus-seeking discussion outside of formal Holacracy meetings.</p><p>(Which raises another, almost-meta question for your organisation's Holacracy practise: Do people feel safe and empowered to process&nbsp;their tensions in Holacracy meetings? That fact that people are processing their governance-related tensions&nbsp;outside of meetings might indicate a problem there.)&nbsp;</p></dd>
