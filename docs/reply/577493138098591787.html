  <dd><p>I'd say it's very likely that adding some kind of comp impact for filling those roles&nbsp;is going to create all manner of issues, and&nbsp;likely make the problem worse.&nbsp; I'd suggest&nbsp;the issue here isn't that those roles are&nbsp;excluded -&nbsp;that's just a symptom.&nbsp; Rather, the issue is with your comp system typing comp to achieving KPI's; that practice has all sorts of problems, and I'd say you'd do far better re-engineering your comp system to remove that aspect of it in the first place.&nbsp; If you haven't already, consider reading Dan Pink's book Drive, which covers that practice in depth, and shares a lot science that suggests it's probably not a desirable practice.</p></dd>
