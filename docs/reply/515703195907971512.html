  <dd><p>Hi Yan,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We work with many software companies that have a similar management tool system and that&nbsp;question often comes up.</p><p>There are many different ways of doing the “Progress Update” step of the tactical meeting:</p><p>1/ You could use GlassFrog and all circle members could just update GlassFrog with their main projects/the projects they deem useful to share updates on</p><p>+ : it allows to have only the essential projects</p><p>- : it takes some time to update GlassFrog on top of your management system</p><p>2/ You could do the progress update on Trello and in this case, I wouldn't go through each project as a facilitator but rather frame a bit and ask per role or person: “go through all your projects and give update only if there is an update to share or move on to the next project”</p><p>+ : the process is&nbsp;very efficient and you don't have to copy/paste project on GlassFrog</p><p>- : you have two platforms for the tactical meeting and need to juggle between Trello and GlassFrog</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At iGi, we only use GlassFrog for tactical meetings and of course, everyone has its own trusted system so we still need to copy/paste the main projects/projects other roles would like visibility on GlassFrog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, I'd like to draw your attention on the fact that this step is actually “Progress Update” and not just “Project Updates”</p><p>See section 4.2.3 of the Constitution: “<strong>(d) Progress Updates:</strong> During this step, the Facilitator asks each participant to highlight progress towards achieving any Project or expressing any Accountability of any of the participant’s Roles in the Circle. Participants may only share progress made since the last report given, and not the general status of a Project or Accountability. Each participant may decide which Projects or Accountabilities are worth reporting on, however if another Circle Member explicitly requested updates on a specific Project, that one must be included until it’s either completed or dropped. For progress updates about a Project or Accountability of a Sub-Circle, the Facilitator must allow both the Lead Link and Rep Link of the Sub-Circle the opportunity to share updates.”</p></dd>
