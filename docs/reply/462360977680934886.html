  <dd>Hi, Davi:<br /><br />We also have a circle which is somewhat cross functional (marketing, r&d,sales, production,<br />distribution) and we are applying Scrum principles with this circle.<br /><br />We use only one sprint backlog for the entire circle, and all of the stories are user stories or spikes. Sometimes the stories feel a little forced because we put them in user story format. However, I would argue that everything we do has to improve something for the customer and none of the roles should just do something for the sake of its own role.<br /><br />The Sprint backlog also mixes things that are more "marketing" in nature, or more "distribution", along with things that are "development".<br /><br />Now, we may be cheating a little or not doing it right <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" />. The development itself is actually outsourced to a different circle, a development circle and this circle focuses only in development.<br />The "development" role in the first circle is a customer of the development circle.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: We are not a software development company - we have RnD folks, but not software developers <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" />, so maybe the challenges are a bit different)<br /><br />Looking at your question, perhaps you can do something similar, or have a Scrum in Scrum type of arrangement, where you create a "development" sub circle under your business unit circle, so that the development work gets separated out from all the other types of work at the business unit circle.<br /><br />Then again, if you do use this arrangement, your business unit circle does not need to use scrum. It can use whatever project tracking and prioritization method it likes.<br /><br />We just chose to implement (or experiment maybe the better word) scrum principles to an entire business unit circle.<br /><br />Hope this reply is in line with your question.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Dien.</dd>
