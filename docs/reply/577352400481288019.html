  <dd><p>Matheus,</p><p>It looks like you've named your two tensions and so I would encourage you to try to process it in governance with any solution you find viable. It can be helpful to get specific on them.&nbsp;</p><p>- Validate the&nbsp;strategy... What does that mean to you? How is what's currently happening not meeting your need?&nbsp;</p><p>- Distributing Lead Link Accountabilities... What accountabilities are not happening? Do you have and idea of a system that would work?</p><p>In an anchor circle without a lead link the work typically done by the lead link can happen during a governance meeting until governance is written otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>It is ok to try something that you think will solve your tension. If it isn't perfect we can at least learn from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, you'd try your idea of having a large all encompassing circle then you would experience if it was too bureaucratic or not.</p><p>The tool I usually look to for distributing those accountabilities is policy. You can use a policy to grant authorities that were lead link authorities to a specific process or role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is the fun of the practice of Holacracy, keep at it!</p><p>Jenn</p></dd>
