  <dd><p>Hi Frederik, I was wondering if translation in GlassFrog should be allowed per person or just per organization, so it sounds like a yes to per person as well.</p><p>Andrea is right, it is even more complex and honestly something I had never considered. I can see that per person language choice + translation of core roles gets core roles covered, but I'm not sure how you would go about getting the translations of other roles in Holacracy. How do you go about making it proper governance? Would you propose both versions in one proposal, or propose translations, or something else? Or, maybe you haven't gotten to that point because GlassFrog doesn't support it!</p><p>In any case,&nbsp;I'll add it to the list to consider once we've got the basics&nbsp;of internationalization in place.</p></dd>
