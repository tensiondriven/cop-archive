  <dd><p>I'm new to Holacracy and do not have experience working within the system yet. But as an outside observer, I'd like to add that I do not see "values of clarity, individual&nbsp;responsibility, duties, differentiation" as inherently masculine. On the contrary, I see inclusion, communication, and distributed power as being quite contrary to the power ranking and ego driven values often associated with the "alpha male" mentality.&nbsp;<br />I agree that Holacracy has the potential to be neutral in this way, with the added bonus of smoothing out the worst impulses and encouraging the best impulses of both "male" and "female" values.</p></dd>
