  <dd><p>Hello&nbsp;[@mention:590725801077679128],</p><p>1. We did not do any constitution amendments yet.<br />2. We dont have any specific policies/domains yet to address it.</p><p>Now we use the basic construct of Holacracy. Domain "All Company property &amp; ordinary business affairs" and Lead Link's accountability "Allocating the Circleâ€™s resources across its various Projects and/or Roles".</p><p>We, as a Board transfer our expectation about finances on LL of GCC with his appointment to that role or role-fits further in the future. I can imagine in the future to make a policy to above mentioned domain about finances in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Board circle, which GCC will have to follow. E.g. Operational expenses can be maximum of 80 % of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gross profit margin.</p><p>What to you think? What are your ideas about it?</p></dd>
