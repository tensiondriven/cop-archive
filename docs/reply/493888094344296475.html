  <dd><p>Hey Carrie,</p><p>A few thoughts that come up in addition to Bernard Marie's answer:</p><p>Who is WE in your question? That might give you an indication where to start processing. Might be a tension of a role in one of the nested circles then use the rep link to process it to the super-circle. Practically in the super-circle it is a governance proposal to "restructure sub-circle". And it would probably need separate steps to move it into another nested sub-circle.</p><p>However, I think it is important to be clear and intentional why you are harming circle boundaries in case processing of that tension is started within the super-circle and not triggered by rep links.&nbsp;</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
