  <dd><p>Hi Jeffrey,</p><p>I've been thinking along similar lines:&nbsp;that&nbsp;the internationalization/translation work might allow GlassFrog to better support other versions and derivatives for the constitution, as long as the changes are only in the wording, and not in the functionality itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that pulling from the constitution itself could be tricky, but&nbsp;there might be some viable interim steps in there.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for sharing - I've been wondering how many orgs are using modified constitutions in those ways, and it helps me to hear about the use cases!</p></dd>
