  <dd><p>Thank you for your replies. I ended up not proposing anything but just creating&nbsp;a new chores plan and invited the role "Office care taker" to discuss it over coffee. I realised that the issue is simply not important enough to take it to the tactical&nbsp;meeting. Also, I reminded myself&nbsp;that everything that is done in a tactical can also be done outside of the meeting.</p></dd>
