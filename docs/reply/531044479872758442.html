  <dd><p>This thread and the one concerning Gamification should unite.. .</p><p>While I like the idea of a game for training, why not set up a circle in the existing or emerging organization that agrees to run holacracy and learn in real time. There's something about the game that avoids realtime commitment and I wonder what the tension is that's really driving this conversation. .. if I were cynical, I'd say just install it in a circle and avoid creating a product that stands between no holacracy and bringing the value of holacracy into the organization. On the other hand, the entrepreneur in me wished I had thought of the idea for creating a product that helps bridge the skeptics from status quo to status go.&nbsp;</p></dd>
