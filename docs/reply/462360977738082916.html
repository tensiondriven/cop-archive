  <dd>Hi Keith, like your thinking! <br /><br />Here a few thoughts in random order:<br />- I would love to explicit link in the Glassfrog of an organizations governance records and the version of the (potentially forked) constitution they use<br />- adopting a new/updated constitution in larger organizations can be quite a thing so good to make explicit how it works<br />- how upgrading works could be defined by the constitution but maybe also by a role in the anchor circle eg a constitution steward that can propose a constitution upgrade. Together with a policy that says something like "as long as there is no objection from any of the other anchor circle members as expressed through IDM in a special announced meeting and the change in constitution is explained throughout the organization by the "chain of command" of the secretaries (just like facilitators have an accountability in the case of process breakdown).</dd>
