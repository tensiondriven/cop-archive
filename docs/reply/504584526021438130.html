  <dd><p>We had the experience that some projects do not have update for quite a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we just suggest to put those projects on hold - so that we don't ask about it every time. Then if it stays so for long, then we examine if that is still aligned with our strategy, if not, then we abandon that project.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on what I know, in Holacracy, we cannot really tell people how to do things or give deadlines - it's up for the person to manage their work and priority. &nbsp;So if a project should have updates but is not having it, then someone is bound to have tension, and can raise it at Tac meeting to propose a next action/project related.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
