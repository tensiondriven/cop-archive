  <dd><p>Here's my interpretation: A role to which a domain has been granted has the right to define policies that regulate how it is impacted - even outside of Governance meetings. For those policies to have the intended effect they need to be published and visible. So unpublished policies are not valid until publication. You can't really expect others to honor them if they are unaware of them.&nbsp;</p></dd>
