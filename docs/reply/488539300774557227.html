  <dd><p>Thanks Olivier. I actually knew this already, but had forgotten. This is a critical piece of emphasis and makes a clear distinction from what most people are used to. It's easy for people that are not very experienced, like me, to get a little lost by focusing on the rules, regs and roles. Relying on old paradigms to interpret the new system, one looks to roles to see what people are authorised to do, whereas it seems the explicit assumption in Holacracy is that you are authorised to do anything to progress the work of the circle so long as it is not restricted by other people's roles or policies. Even then, under certain urgent circumstances...</p><p>This simple realisation has deepened my understanding and appreciation of the system very significantly so thanks again.</p></dd>
