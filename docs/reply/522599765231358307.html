  <dd><p>Hi Harald,&nbsp;</p><p>I think it would probably depend on what kind of information you are trying to disseminate and why. In the GlassFrog circle, we typically use role notes, Slack, or email to provide transparency into&nbsp;things that everyone in the circle needs to know, rather than relying on the tactical meetings. In my experience, the first Holacracy question isn't how to disseminate information, but rather what role is responsible for disseminating it, and what roles need to know the information. I'm not a Holacracy coach, but that would be where I would start.&nbsp;</p></dd>
