  <dd><p>Brian -</p><p>Agreed in the short, quick, colloquial - and - what gets defined as colloquial may vary based on team/organization tradition. &nbsp;The phrase 'what would you like to have happen here' is pretty darned common in peer-facilitated support groups and events, which is much of what MKP provides. &nbsp;So that tongue-tripper isn't all that onerous for us to consider use of, and has been useful in our boot-strapping study groups. &nbsp;Specifically it's useful as a reminder to each that it's not the Facilitator's responsibility to 'fix' or provide solutions but rather to support the individual in finding their own solutions within the construct.</p><p>BUT, it may not translate more broadly - so your 'what would you like' and its variants may be more applicable. &nbsp;Some additional, more general language spaghetti-on-wall, considering that the individual has expressed something about their Tension by this point.</p><p>- "How can we help?" ('how can we help you address that Tension?', 'how can we support you in addressing that tension?')</p><p>- "What might help?" &nbsp;('what might help you address that Tension?')</p><p>or if they have not yet stated the Tension...</p><p>- "What is your Tension and how can we help?"</p><p>or such</p></dd>
