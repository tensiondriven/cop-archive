  <dd><p>Hi Jeffrey,</p><p>I mainly use the format when typing up my tensions into GlassFrog, but I try to keep it in mind when requesting things of other roles. I think the part that is easy to forget is the "so that", which helps others to understand the why behind it - sometimes what I'm asking for isn't actually going to meet the need, so I think that helps to provide the information to the recipient. But, as a general rule in Holacracy, I feel like you rarely go wrong by telling others what role you are acting from!</p></dd>
