  <dd><p>I would do as bernard marie says, and schedule a governance meeting to elect a new facilitator. Typically the metrics list is built by the lead link, and checklists and projects built by the people doing the work, outside of tactical meetings.</p><p>The facilitator needs to follow the process specified in the constitution unless the governance records specify another operational meeting process. Standing by while a facilitator picks and chooses which part of the process is using personal power instead of the process, and should be stopped as soon as it is recognized...hope you will let us know what you try.</p><p>Does this answer your question Shammi?</p></dd>
