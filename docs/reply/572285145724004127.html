<p>Thanks for your inputs.</p><p>[@mention:449974511452179429], I'm not sure I caught the connection with articles 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 in this matter. I guess you meant 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 ?</p><p>If I try to synthesize all the pieces :</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Governance meeting attendance</span> (<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art331" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 3.3.1</a>) :&nbsp;<em>All <strong>Core Circle Members</strong> are entitled to fully participate in all Governance Meetings of a Circle [...]&nbsp;<strong>no one else</strong> is allowed to participate in a Circle’s Governance Meetings <strong>unless explicitly invited by a Policy of the Circle</strong>.</em></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusion from multi-filled role</span> (<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art232" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 2.3.2</a>) : <em>[...]&nbsp;the Circle may enact a Policy that limits how many of them are Core Circle Members [...]</em></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusion for minor allocation</span> (<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 2.3.3</a>) : <em>[...]&nbsp;the Lead Link may exclude that Partner from serving as a Core Circle Member [...]</em></p><p>Still not clear sometimes for me of what I could do or not with a policy, especially when trying to "overrule" the constitution.</p><p>My understanding is :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Election takes place in the governance meeting</li><li>To be able to attend the governance, you need to be core circle member or invited (many ways)</li><li>An election is a tension brought during the governance. You can ask for a specific governance meeting for an election, but you don't have to.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>=&gt; So, what we would need is a policy that somehow could&nbsp;ask for dedicated governance meeting for any election and allow all circle members (not only core members) to attend to it.</p><p>Nothing would forbid that ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
