It can stay as the “family property” until some tensions arise and you need to put more clarity by delegating part of the domain on a role for example or by defining a policy in the governance of the circle. In this scenario, it would no longer be the family property.</p></div></blockquote><p>I have had the same understanding, but this seems to be at odds with the Constitution.
