  <dd><p>hi&nbsp;[@mention:491495232183315418]&nbsp;- agree. the simplest form for APs (FTE or budget) I have done is through publishing a note on the role page of the Lead Link (or whichever role in each circle is the appropriate holder of this information).</p><p>Advantages: You can start it in a couple of minutes. Updates are send around the circle automatically. And each Lead Link has some good autonomy to do it in a way she/he likes.</p><p>The primary drawback is that the note doesn't automatically calculate the sum of the points so it is a bit of a manual process especially across circles. And it requires deliberate attention (a habit) of each circle to make it work (that might also be a good thing to not automate this too much).</p><p>This&nbsp;might especially be harder to manage for larger organizations, but that at least is a good tension to then introduce a separate system. An intermediate step could be a google sheet or excel which you link to for each circle to solve the "difficulty of calculation totals and differences" tension.</p><p>I had a client that created a dedicated web-app for attention points that integrated with Glassfrog through the API. They will present it at the forum in May.</p><p>Koen</p></dd>
