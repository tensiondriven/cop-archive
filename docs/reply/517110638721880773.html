  <dd><p>@Chris, I believe the tension came from the inclusion of the word "project" not "update". I agree that "update" infers "progress" but my interpretation was that "project" infers "not accountabilities". The Constitution seems more broad with its intent for the round asking "each participant to highlight progress towards achieving any Project or expressing&nbsp;<strong>any Accountability</strong>..." It goes on to specify&nbsp;"<strong>not the general status</strong>" of these items, but I don't know what would qualify as a progress update for an accountability. Accountabilities are a checklist item, at best, as I am personally not interested in hearing about recurring/BAU tasks. Any issues impeding progress on those would/should be brought up as tensions for triage.</p><p>I guess I should have also mentioned the option to change the wording in the Constitution, but I that would be more in Constitution Steward's domain.
