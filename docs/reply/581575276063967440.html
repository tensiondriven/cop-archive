  <dd><p>I get asked this question a lot, and I give a different answer than Jean-Michel's.&nbsp; The tactical meeting is all about getting the tension&nbsp;holder what they need, and&nbsp; brainstorming is absolutely welcomed during the tactical meeting if that's what they need -&nbsp;it's just a request for help of a certain type (one of the five common requests/pathways on the back of our <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tactical meeting process card</a>).</p><p>However, the time allowed for it is limited; as&nbsp;Facilitator, I mentally calculate how many minutes we have per item on the agenda, and then allow about that many minutes per agenda item.&nbsp; If the agenda&nbsp;has only a few tensions on it, that may allow space for a longer brainstorm; and if there are a lot of&nbsp;tensions on it, the agenda owner may only have a few minutes.&nbsp; But within whatever time box they've got, it is the agenda owner that effectively controls how that space is used, not me the Facilitator.</p><p>The other issue I'm watching for as Facilitator with a request for brainstorming is why the person wants it; is it to help them get ideas (which is just fine), or is it really to seek buy-in/consensus so&nbsp;"we" can decide something and the agenda owner can duck using their own power/authority autocratically - if I sense it's that, I'm going to coach on the power structure of Holacracy&nbsp;and invite them to reframe their request (to just getting ideas so they can make their autocratic decision in their role that's already empowered to make it).</p></dd>
