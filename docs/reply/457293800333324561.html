  <dd><p>Hi, Jean:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Yes, you're right <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" /> &nbsp;I keep teaching people to do just this, but in these instances I don't do it myself.</p><p>The more I think about it, most of the issues do indeed stem from overlap of roles and confusion of who csn make the decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Yes, you're right too here. In these cases, since they can't seem to solve the problem, they automatically turn to me, as they normally did prior to Holacracy. I offered to facilitate, because I would otherwise feel bad for completely turning down the request to solve the problem, even though I don't have that role, and it is not helping in transitioning to a more distributed authority system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Changing mindsets and habits (including mine) turns out to be a bigger job than I originally thought <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
