  <dd><p>I do think those&nbsp;who know&nbsp;the rules and how to use them effectively have more power to lead their roles in service of the organization's purpose.&nbsp; I'm not sure I'd say they get more personal power to meet their own personal goals; perhaps that too, but only to the extent it doesn't&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;the organization, assuming you have a decent overall Holacracy practice at play.&nbsp; And I think it's worth noting that&nbsp;Holacracy was never&nbsp;intended as a tool to redistribute either of these kinds of power, nor one to make everyone equal in them.&nbsp; It's rather intended as a tool to remove the structural limits on how much of these kinds of power people can claim and use.&nbsp; Or, said another way, the goal isn't to remove power from the top and distribute it; it is to increase power throughout the system, so everyone can claim and use as much power as they're&nbsp;individually capable of.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to make&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;equal in this regard, or somehow cap the power of the ex-CEO (or anyone else), would be quite limiting to the organization's purpose, and the whole point of Holacracy practice is to free people to lead so they can better express that purpose.</p><p>Hope those additional distinctions are useful!</p><p>- Brian</p><p>PS:&nbsp; Just for the record, I'm not the ex-CEO of HolacracyOne; I held that title in my last company before HolacracyOne, but I've never held that title in this organization, because we started with Holacracy from the beginning and never centralized&nbsp;power in a CEO role in the first place.</p></dd>
