  <dd><p>Laurent, based on a discussion with Brian we ended up creating separate roles for each team, which worked out very well for us.</p><p>As we went through the process of mapping roles it became apparent that each team&nbsp;had different accountabilities for developers and sys admins, etc. Some teams even had roles that others didn't (e.g. Tech Support role vs. accountability for tech support on Developer role).</p><p>I was quite surprised as we're a small company (~40 people) doing more or less the same work for each client. That said, the teams have had a about 18 months to differentiate before we adopted Holacracy - it was an interesting exercise to sit down and map this out.</p><p>We did discuss creating "template" roles in our Delivery super-circle for&nbsp;use when starting a new team. We&nbsp;decided against this as it&nbsp;turned out to be more&nbsp;simple to start by&nbsp;copying a role from another team and then modifying to suit. I noticed that the feature list for constitution 5.0 has a suggestion for template roles.</p></dd>
