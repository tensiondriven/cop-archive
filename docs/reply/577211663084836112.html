  <dd><p>I see what you mean. However, I think that,&nbsp;as a facilitator, you can add or emphasize more&nbsp;togetherness, connectedness, caring, helping, shared responsibility and flow. In other words, the process can be made more neutral even if there is a tendency on being very "masculine", as you pointed out.</p><p>Interesting reflexion, by the way. Curious to know what others think about it.</p></dd>
