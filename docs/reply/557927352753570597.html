  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:553141978014385339]&nbsp;in the <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art11" target="_blank">Constitution&nbsp;</a>article 1.1(b) the definition of the Domain is about "things". If you replace "things" with "resource" then you have the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>The Domain is the "fence" around any resource of the Organization which is exclusively control by a Role or a Circle. As long as the control is not delegated then is a "Resource" which can be impacted or controlled by anyone as long as is not forbidden by the Constitution or a Policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is more clearer now?</p></dd>
