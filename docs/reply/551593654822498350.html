  <dd><p>I interpret it&nbsp;similarly to&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353].&nbsp;</p><p>A concrete example that may or may not speak to you:&nbsp;</p><p>At HolacracyOne, I fill the <strong>Website Strategy</strong> role with a domain on "<em>The holacracy.org and the glassfrog.com public-facing (non-app) websites</em>"</p><p>Based on this domain alone, my role seems to control the entire websites so I can do whatever I want with them. However, some GCC policies add some constraints, such as this policy:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><span><strong>Visual representations of the brands must follow the official Graphic Style Guide:</strong><br />Any role releasing products and materials that graphically represent the Holacracy or HolacracyOne brands must align with the Graphic Style Guide defined by <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/8184">Brand Visual Design</a>.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>And this one:</span></p><blockquote><p><span><span><strong>Messaging Standards for the Holacracy Brand:</strong><br /></span></span></p><p>... (a) All prominent mentions of the brand must include a "Â®" symbol next to it.&nbsp;...</p><p>(b) All printed or digital documents marketing the brand should include the following statement somewhere in the copy, typically at the bottom of the page or the footer of the webpage: "Holacracy is a trademark of HolacracyOne, LLC."</p><p>(c) The name "Holacracy" should be used consistently without spelling deviation: use it capitalized, don't use a translation (e.g. Holacratie, Holakratie), don't transform it into an adjective (e.g. holacratic). &nbsp;...</p></blockquote><p>So I can change the website however&nbsp;makes sense for my role, <em><strong>but</strong></em>&nbsp;within the constraints of&nbsp;these policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, proposing a circle policy limiting a delegated domain&nbsp;is valid governance, however it might be a bad idea and someone might have an objection (it would not be a "Not valid governance" objection, but it could be another objection - depending on the specifics)&nbsp;</p></dd>
