Especially as people normally need time to prepare and think about a blog article. So I feel as the founder, I created the company, I own most of it and I see it as “my baby” and therefore want to look at the overall picture. I do deeply care about the overall company and feel responsible for it. So when situations like the ones above happen, I just cannot get myself to let it go and wait what happens. I don’t want to get into a state were I don’t care anymore and see it more “relaxed”. At the same time this creates some interpersonal tensions as people feel I am poking too often.</p></div></blockquote><p>Florian, I am a bit late to the party,&nbsp;but I still want to offer you a perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>For me, the key is in the part I quoted above. Specifically: "I just cannot get myself to let it go and wait what happens."</p><p>In understand that you&nbsp;don't want to <em>wait</em> and therefore you <em>poke</em>.</p><p>I am thinking that instead of poking / reminding people, you could<strong>&nbsp;inquire about their relative priorities</strong>: "Hey,&nbsp;you agreed to work on this blog post, but I don't see it happening. Could you tell me what is going on / what other things you are working on at the moment?" As a colleague, I would appreciate this open question much more than a "poke", especially since it comes from the founder and&nbsp;majority shareholder.</p><p>If you are the Lead Link you could set a strategy that guides this (but it sounded to me that you are not the Lead Link here, is that right?).</p><p>A second thought that comes to mind, is that <strong>you may actually be filling a role that is not captured yet</strong>. Is there a role in your organisation that would have a general responsibility for "publishing" or "marketing" or so? Which role actually&nbsp;cares about&nbsp;those blogposts? Do you hold&nbsp;any of them? If not, you may want to create a role that holds the larger responsibility for the area you have an interest in developing. (In Structure &amp; Process we have "<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/8586759" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Event Business</a>" and "<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/12926" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consulting Business</a>"&nbsp;as&nbsp;roles that look at larger business areas. They&nbsp;sometimes nudge&nbsp;people who hold roles such as Sales, or Marketing, or individual Event Project Leads to get down with things. (We don't "poke" in @strucproc, we <em>gently nudge</em>. <img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" title=";)" />)&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I think <strong>the need to speak as "the founder" or "the majority shareholder" or a person otherwise strongly personally being impacted by company decisions is perfectly valid</strong>!</p><p>For myself, being the founder&nbsp;and owner of Structure &amp; Process, I use a Role called "<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/15656" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Founder / Owner Context</a>" which is modeled on a stakeholder representation role I saw in H1. The accountability is: "Representing the founder / owner's world within the organisation".</p><p>Having this role on the GCC allows me to speak from personal tensions, such as&nbsp;worries or frustrations &nbsp;- or from joy and care.&nbsp;</p><p>I use it to share information for the company mostly, as what happens in my personal life often has an impact on the business. When I <em>do</em> use it to&nbsp;put pressure on roles or criticise other people's decisions, it is clear where this is coming from: From a strong personal sense of tension, which is probably an expression of care for my own and the company's well-being. (That is my personal test for speaking from this role: Am I actually speaking from love and care, or am I just frustrated that things are not&nbsp;the way I'd like them to be?) The role also makes clear that when I give impulses from it,&nbsp;I am not pretending to know what is best for the business: I am merely giving my view from my personal position.</p><p>Of course, this is a pretty intense&nbsp;thing to do: I am the only person who has a Role that is specifically designed to do this! This intensity gives me an extra clarity on when I need this space, and, more importantly, when I _don't_. It gives me a moment of mindfulness to check if I am controlling or acting from boss-think rather than with a collegial attitude.&nbsp;I can then consciously decide wether to proceed with a soft inquiry or a piece of feedback as a colleague; or to a "poke" and&nbsp;request from the strong role.<br /><br />(Side note: I also have a role as "company historian", which allows me to share information from the past as a neutral resource, rather than it sounding that I know everything better. This allows for expressions such as: "Nice idea. As Historian I want to tell you that we have tried it before and it never worked, and as Founder I would like to encourage you to use your freedom and decide for yourself what is wise!")&nbsp;</p><p>This has been a long answer. Thank you for sharing and asking, this has been fun to sense&nbsp;into and think about!</p>  </div>
