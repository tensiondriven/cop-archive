  <dd><p>I like everything I'm reading - and it's to be noted that without use of something like Asana or other task/project management, that there is a minor but appreciable gap in GlassFrog - around ACTIONS.</p><p>While PROJECTS created during Tactical (or offline) are created and therefore reviewable, ACTIONS disappear except for email notification and meeting history. We've jury-rigged a manual solution with an external Checklist/Metric spreadsheet in Google that our @Secretary copy/pastes action items in then expect circle members to mark completion and/or note prior to each tactical, and have included some review of that tab in spreadsheet into our preamble.</p></dd>
