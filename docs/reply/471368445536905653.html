  <dd><p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>Paul is right - it is more involved than dropping in the localization files for language support. I can see why you might expect otherwise, though. GlassFrog has grown and evolved alongside of Holacracy pretty much from the beginning.&nbsp;If you are familiar with Ruby on Rails, GlassFrog development started sometime in or before 2008 on Rails 2.0, which is before the drop-in localization support, and GlassFrog was never retrofitted. I think GlassFrog is actually older than HolacracyOne, but I don't remember for sure. I think they might have been programming it on punch cards or stone tablets.</p><p>In any case, as GlassFrog Product Manager, internationalization has been on my radar, and&nbsp;I was hoping to start spec'ing it out next year once we had this January release under our belts. But, as&nbsp;Tom Thomison likes to say "Reality will have its way with you", and I've actually been spec'ing it out most of today to try to determine how to&nbsp;fit in the development roadmap, and what sorts of things to consider.&nbsp;</p></dd>
