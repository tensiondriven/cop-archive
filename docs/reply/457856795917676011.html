  <dd><p>Hi Jean, Dien,&nbsp;thanks for replying. appreciate it a lot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I agree with that adding a general circle policy is a nice route to take. as it makes explicit how another role gets access to the resource allocation accountability of the Lead Link by default. eg its prevents handling/labeling it as something like Lead Link "approval".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lets dive into this one step deeper. Lets say I am helping a larger organization that still has a few old school budget processes and control accountabilities hanging around. Fully letting go of that is not safe enough to try (assumption to build this case, but probably an objection that could happen in real life easily). So what I was looking for is a way to refer to the lead link so resource allocation remains with the Lead Link, but making explicit other roles (eg finance/control/budgetprep) have a role in preparing/supporting that Lead Link accountability. Thats why I was looking in the accountability of this supporting role to refer in its accountability explicitly to the Lead Link. As an intermediary way to power up the Lead Link role. And that reference didnt seem possible.</p></dd>
