<p>Hi Sam,</p><p>I typically try to avoid cross-linking in early implementations. I have often seen tendencies to link each circle with every other in order to overcome the pain the org experienced in their former structure: lack of information flow, bad sync on interfaces, power games who ultimately rules...etc.</p><p>A few thoughts on how I&nbsp;experience it/coach in practice:&nbsp;</p><p>1) High need for cross-linking might be a good marker for a structure that is not&nbsp;the most requisite regarding&nbsp;the orgs current needs. Rather than "circling" former teams/departments ask which work needs to live close in order to have the most cohesive bundle or work in a circle. So use the "tension" of need of cross-linking&nbsp;to reflect on your setup.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Instead of cross linking you might ask which additional perspective the circle needs to better&nbsp;express its&nbsp;purpose? E.g instead of cross-linking you&nbsp;could create a simple role in your circle that brings in a specific lens (filled by people holding relevant information due to other role-filling in other circles). This is&nbsp;sometimes enough and replaces the initial need for cross-linking.&nbsp;</p><p>3) The most important thing to me in practice - having seen struggles with cross-circle navigation: I frame Gov as a way to continuously create/establish clarity of where acc and authority reside.&nbsp;Once roles are&nbsp;clear (continuously beta)&nbsp;you can "disregard" the structure and use&nbsp;role clarity for highly-efficient role-to-role interaction. No matter which circle they are in. In "mature" practice the aspect of&nbsp;"harming" circle boundaries by walking up to roles directly becomes less relevant IMHO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>May that triggers some thoughts.</p><p>- Gerald</p>  </div>
