  <dd><p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, only core circle members can be elected as Secretary or Facilitator. My interpretation is that it does mean that a Partner may not fill only the Secretary or Facilitator role in a circle, unless they've been elected before when they were assigned to a role and were removed recently (but, in this case, are they core circle members? Good question!). The reasons I&nbsp;can see for that rule is that:</p><p>1- it takes time to attend meetings so more efficient to have one or more roles involved in the meeting</p><p>2- both roles need to be intimate with the governance records, knowing the different roles and authorities at play to interpret if needed (for the secretary) or to audit it (facilitator)</p><p>At the beginning, for new circles, we do recommend to have an outsider “neutral” though...</p></dd>
