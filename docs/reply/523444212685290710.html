  <dd><p>IMO the only test is to just do it, if it is safe enough to try. It's as simple as a governance proposal within the super circle by someone that has the tension (for instance the rep or lead link of the sub circle).&nbsp;</p><p>Re not much to discuss in tacticals: this is indeed a sign that the circle is maybe mostly overhead. Usually you'd have a few roles with a dozen projects and metrics, that should trigger enough updates that trigger enough tensions to have &nbsp;a meaningful tactical in my experience.</p></dd>
