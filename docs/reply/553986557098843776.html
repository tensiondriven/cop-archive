  <dd><p>Reading your feedback regarding my plan , worries me a little bit. So I think I am going to share this feedback to the team and ask them if they are adventurous enough to try. Which I think we are. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>But I think we will consider looking for coach as well. How to do so in this forum? We are in Jakarta Indonesia, so maybe some sort of online coaching is the way to go.</p></dd>
