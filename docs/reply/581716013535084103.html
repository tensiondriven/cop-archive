  <dd><p>Thanks [@mention:457856795977603624]</p><p>I like how you framed the aspirational purpose as leaving room for novelty or innovation.&nbsp; I think an aspirational&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;is the best becuase it is a role we thing should exist in an ongoing fashion.&nbsp; IF they ever did meet their purposes' directive, the role would end.&nbsp; That said, if it is a very specific role I could see where a very directive purpose is helpful.&nbsp; As you say though, then it sounds like an accountability and not a purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
