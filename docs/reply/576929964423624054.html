  <dd><p>If you're trying to interpret that yourself as Facilitator&nbsp;either way, you're already doing something wrong - it's not the Facilitator's job to interpret and assess whether objections are valid or not, and you don't have the authority to do so anyway.&nbsp; It's just the Facilitator's job to ask questions and&nbsp;get&nbsp;the objector to assess and tell you whether it's valid or not (we spend a lot of time on this in our <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/events#pt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Practitioner Trainings</a> - it's a key nuance that's often missed and can undermine the whole practice).&nbsp; So in this case, I'd&nbsp;first take a short time-out to explain to the objector that they would still have the full authority to do anything to serve their role's purpose, including&nbsp;doing that accountability whether or not it's explicit, and all removing an accountability does is stop others from necessarily expecting that the role-filler will do that particular thing, without in any way limiting the role-filler from doing so if they think it makes sense for the purpose. Then, I'd end the time out and simply ask, "Now that you know that,&nbsp;do you see any reasons why dropping that as an expectation, while still leaving you free to choose to do it or not as you see fit, will cause harm?".&nbsp; And if they say yes, I'd ask for the reason - i.e. for the argument to that specific question; tell me how it will cause harm even knowing they could still do it.&nbsp; And then I might run whatever argument they give through the other test questions.&nbsp; If they answer them all with a reason for the specific question asked, it's valid by definition; I never have to assess validity myself.</p></dd>
