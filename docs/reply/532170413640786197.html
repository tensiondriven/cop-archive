  <dd><p>Hey Philippe, there is a lot to say here... as iGi Partners has accompanied many cases like yours, being a (small) part within a (very) large organizations. I have not enough energy/time now to dig into that very interesting subject, but one key is communication - explaining and making it clear what is going on in such unit having decided to implement Holacracy. When people begin to practice Holacracy, they will use new words, be more precise, get into new mental models and the others will witness such change and could be afraid... and wondering what's going on.</p></dd>
