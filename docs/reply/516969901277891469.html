  <dd><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"My understanding of the term triage in Holacracy is that no solutions are created in the tactical meeting but only decisions are made on what are the next steps (next action, project, wait for trigger, think about a tension)&nbsp;to be followed."</em></p><p>It depends what you mean with "solutions are created": In my experience, we do sometimes "create solutions" within Tactical Meetings! (Our team is relatively small though, and we take our time for Tacticals, so we have the space.)</p><p>However, more often, the Tactical is used to identify what exactly is stuck and who / what Roles are needed to continue working on the issue: They will then meet outside of the Tactical to get down&nbsp;with the work.</p><p>I quite enjoy this way of working, as it relieves the plenary meeting from detailed discussions that are&nbsp;not relevant to all.</p></dd>
