  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Paul Walker posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>When I implemented Holacracy, we abandoned the concept of not being able to abstain VERY quickly. We do talk about the importance of voting, but ultimately let people opt-out if they want to.</p><p>My assumption was the rule that nobody can abstain is just to make sure that nobody opts-out of voting, but still objects to whoever was nominated. We just took it as "You can abstain if you want to, but you won't have a say in the rest of the process, including the objection round."</p></div></blockquote><p>I like this approach, it makes complete sense, although I still would like to know the reasoning behind the decision of not allowing people to opt-out.</p></dd>
