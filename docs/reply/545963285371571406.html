  <dd><p>In a previous organization I once had a marketing agency come in that got started with questions like "if you were a supermarket, which one would it be and why?", if your company was an animal, which one and why?". same for cars, cities/countries/sportsmen...Or what would you like your customers to say about you? Or if you celebrated your organizations 100th birthday - what would be the tone and praise of the speaches given by your customers/shareholders/employees/suppliers/...&nbsp;</p><p>By making these kind of analogies&nbsp;you can step outside of your organization&nbsp;and use all the emerging ideas to channel back into the organization to craft a purpose statement.</p><p>For everything else: focus on doing the work and purpose will&nbsp;emerge eventually</p></dd>
