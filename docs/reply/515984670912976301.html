Switching between Glassfrog and Trello shouldn't be a problems for us. This approach should work better for us than to select projects and copy them into Glassfrog.</p><p>Also thank you for bringing up the article on constitution. That also help me get clearer on the purpose of Project Update&nbsp;and reporting in that it's not to 'manage' or 'control' but more about members fulfilling their duty of transparency and providing information to others if they should ask for that.&nbsp;</p></dd>
