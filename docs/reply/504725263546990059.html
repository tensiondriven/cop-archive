  <dd><p>Thanks everyone for the input on this. We ended up doing what Jan said and flipped a coin and broke the tie! :-). Kevin, I agree that it would be ideal if there were fewer options, as that would make it easier. Margaux, yes I too have witnessed how the process can be manipulated. I think as an organisation moves up the Holacracy maturity model though I would expect this to be less so. Would be interesting to get others thoughts on this as well.&nbsp;</p></dd>
