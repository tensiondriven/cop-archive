  <dd><p>Thanks Flavio, it does make a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>I do agree, but in practice, let's say this is a really tedious task that no one really wants to achieve, and that has no way around it (no clever shortcut) -- something as simple&nbsp;as sorting mail for instance (imagine a company having lots of mail).</p><p>In that case, The Role filler believes he needs to outsource it, and creates a circle "Mail", in which he would like to create a few roles to split the task ; he calls for help, but no-one comes. What then ? He follows the Strategy to split his attention between the most important tasks and this new tedious task that is nevertheless necessary ? He raises a new tension the next governance meeting stating that this accountability&nbsp;should be associated to another Role (and another Role filler) otherwise&nbsp;the Company would suffer from his lack of resources to continue his previous accountabilities ?</p><p>Anybody having stories to share about "chores" and unwanted roles ? Rotating "chores" roles/circles ?</p><p>I see 2 big possibilities: retribution (e.g. a demand/offer&nbsp;system that rewards unwanted tasks more than wanted tasks, either financiary or as a worktime reduction bonus for instance...), or organized rotation. Any other ?</p><p>I'm really looking for practical examples here. This may sound stupid, but in small companies such as mine, we don't have dedicated people to handle stuff like manual/practical work (e.g. fix light bulbs, getting trash out, ...). And these still&nbsp;are needed ! In your Holacracy-run companies, who does that ? Does that even appear in your circles ? Or is that the GCC LL doing it <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> ?</p></dd>
