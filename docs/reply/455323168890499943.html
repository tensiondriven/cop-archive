  <dd><p>Hi Leanne,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One way to add a gaming aspect to GF we are trying is setting up some achievements and giving each a point value. Each team member can earn all points so there is an aspect of competition as a group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some examples of achievements might be raising/integrating objection, first time serving as secretary/facilitator, first reference to the Constitution during a meeting, and referring to a role rather than a person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am excited to apply these in my own practice and look forward to other ideas.</p></dd>
