  <dd><p>I'm most interested in the Medium post's comment about communal ownership.&nbsp; As quoted by @Dien:</p><blockquote><p>"More importantly, we found that the act of codifying responsibilities in explicit detail hindered a proactive attitude and sense of communal ownership."</p></blockquote><p>I believe we have at times struggled with the same issue.&nbsp; While I appreciate how Holacracy drives great clarity by eliminating the idea that "we" get work done and instead forces us to define a role that owns a project/action, an unintended consequence at times is that others feel as though they do not have shared responsibility.&nbsp; A simple example, for New Project A:</p><p>Old world.&nbsp; Manager says New Project A has just cropped up and it's important.&nbsp; Hands it to three people and asks that they get it done.&nbsp; They may suffer from some of the challenges Holacracy seeks to avoid -- lack of clarity about who does what, work distribution that is unclear/unfair/inefficient, and so on -- but they maintain a sense that they all achieve or all fail to deliver on New Project A.</p><p>New world.&nbsp; New Project A comes into the circle and we determine that Role X is accountable for that work (due to an existing accountability or a new one).&nbsp; Role X can tap other roles to assist based on their accountabilities, but if none of the preexisting governance directly supports Role X in completing New Project A, Role X may be on his or her own until the governance changes -- which is often after New Project A needs to be done.&nbsp; At least when New Project A clearly falls within Role X's accountabilities, Role X may be solely responsible, with limited shared sense of ownership among the team.&nbsp; With Role X solely responsible, are others staying late at the office to see how they can pitch in outside of their roles?&nbsp; Are others feeling a sense of excitement when New Project A is a huge success, or a sense of personal disappointment or guilt when New Project A does not get done?</p><p>@Dien, it sounds like you have experienced this issue.</p><p>Have others also had this experience?&nbsp; How have you addressed it?&nbsp; @Ruben, I'd be very interested to hear your take -- I greatly appreciated your post in response to that of Medium, but I don't think you touched on this aspect of the Medium announcement.</p></dd>
