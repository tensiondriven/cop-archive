  <dd><p>Hi. I don't know if this will help @Eliana but it may help someone else. Eliana said that people in her organization didn't really have or want to spend the time getting to know one another. However, she had asked David if he had a favorite team building activity. I have quite a lot of experience team-building. Getting-to-know-you type games are often called "icebreakers" in the team-building world. A good website of free icebreaker activities is <a href="https://www.icebreakers.ws/" target="_blank">https://www.icebreakers.ws/</a> and you can also just search for icebreakers on the internet.</p><p>I hope that helps.</p><p>P</p></dd>
