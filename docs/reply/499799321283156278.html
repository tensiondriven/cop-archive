  <dd><p>Koen, there are proven benefits for creativity when it comes to structure. Shakespeare embraced the structure of iambic pentameter, which is tough to compose and still sound coherent. A creative person will overcome the personally imposed limitations of structure when s/he embraces the possibility that the structure allows the opportunity to exercise creativity in a dependable and predictable fashion. Holacracy isn't formless, it is like a plant that is being constantly tended, pruned, guided to meet emerging opportunities and challenges . . . the goal is to become so clear on the way we're all tending the plant that we can trust our own and each other's tending intension.</p><p>One final analogy: as a performing and studio musician tasked with creating audio art, structure is absolutely essential. The key to creative expression is comfort with the tools (i.e., the instrument, the song's patterns, the lyrical ideas and phrasing, etc.). A guitarist plays scales in every key and mode to perform the right note at the right time in the emerging reality of an impromptu solo, which is as true for highly pattern or rule driven music as it is for freeform jazz.</p><p>The fact that there are exceptions to this analogy does not automatically mean that the critics who balk at the idea of practicing are the one in a million prodigy who is beyond improvement through practice. They might just lack the maturity and humility to admit their weakness and risk being improved by something other than their own immaturity and pride. Holacracy will naturally challenge such creatives. However, for the creative willing to admit that there is potential for discovery through pressing up against temporary barriers, holacratic practice may just unlock the latent creativity that only comes from problem solving.</p></dd>
