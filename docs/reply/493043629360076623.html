  <dd><p>Thanks for raising this Koen and for the responses- this is something&nbsp;I've had a query about recently so&nbsp;I'm glad to see this here. If&nbsp;I've understood the conversation so far correctly, then&nbsp;I'd be pleased to hear responses to this slightly different way of articulating it, to see if this is a clear/accurate/simple way of saying it?</p><p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Where a domain <strong>HAS</strong> been delegated to a circle/role, from super-circles all the way from the anchor circle, the domain (and any accompanying policies) applies to <strong>ALL</strong> roles in all circles of the organization.</span></em></p><p class="p2"><em><span class="s1">Where a domain <strong>HAS NOT</strong> been delegated to a circle/role, from super-circles all the way from the anchor circle, the domain (and any accompanying policies) applies <strong>ONLY</strong> with regard to other roles (and of course sub-circles) within the circle, not outside the circle.</span></em></p></dd>
