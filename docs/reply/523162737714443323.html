  <dd><p>Our business only has one call center circle for roughly 40 people. &nbsp;Many are in multi-filled roles using representation. Constitution 2.3.2. They are able to process tensions that way because if there is something their representation doesn't share we try to accommodate the person and their shift to process on their own. &nbsp;Most of the time that isn't the case and the rep can carry the tension well. &nbsp;The downside is they aren't as exposed to the meeting process and education about Holacracy as others and so tensions are much more simple and indicative of new practice. &nbsp;And also, to be honest, they're only going to learn and use the system aso it is useful and productive for them. &nbsp;</p><p>One thing I'm playing with is to create a regularly scheduled circle mini meeting to gather tensions and process issues per shift per role since we're a shift based call center.</p><p>Hope this helps <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
