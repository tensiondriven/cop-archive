  <dd><p>There's much less confusion on who's responsible for what. Balls get dropped less. Those of us who were overworked are less so, and those who didn't have enough to do are busier. There's more sensitivity around stepping on someone else's toes which occasionally leads to unnecessary restraint, but that's something we're growing out of. Everyone is more focused because we have a better understanding of what we're responsible for, and it makes it much easier to prioritize.</p></dd>
