  <dd><p>Jeffery,&nbsp;</p><p>I hear you. The nice thing about a simulation is that people can at least get a sense of the structure/rules without the potential distraction of it being contentious/emotional stuff.</p><p>Ultimately, including emotional dimensions of real work are critical for really understanding Holacracy, but there&nbsp;is something to be said for people playing abstract roles. Since, getting into, and sensing tensions from a role, is THE essential practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, I certainly don't have anything like that yet, but I'll continue working on the whole game idea from my role. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />&nbsp;</p></dd>
