  <dd><p>Hi Alexia,</p><p>While I understand and respect H1's decision to change the pricing model of GlassFrog, I was a little surprised when I did the math for our 8 users and one circle and realized we are facing an increase of 140% in order to keep the functionality we currently have.</p><p>In terms of dollars, this is only an increase from $30 to $72 and I am choosing, as Lead Link of my circle, to make that commitment to supporting our organization's Holacracy practice. Despite that choice, I can't help but feel small groups are taking the brunt of the increase while larger organizations will see decreases in cost.</p><p>I recently spoke to another member of our community with 50 users and lots of circles who, based on the new pricing model, would move from a monthly cost of $495 to $450. While this only represents one anecdotal instance of small group increase and larger group decrease, I found it poignant that we are paying $42 more and they are paying $45 less - pretty close!</p><p>I realize my perspective is one viewed through a lens of very limited financial resources. Having now led&nbsp;two implementations in organizations with less than 10 users, I am already sensitive to the unique hurdles of implementation without coach support.</p><p>That being said, I think the really short version here is...bummer for the little groups! I hope the new and easier pricing model will free up time and energy to add new functionality and make our increase in cost even more worthwhile in the future.</p><p>I will now step down from my soapbox. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
