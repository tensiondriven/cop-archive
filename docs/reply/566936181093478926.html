  <dd><p>Mikolaj, every&nbsp;gap between the current reality and a potential you sense is a Tension. In the Tactical meeting (art 4.2.3(e)) you see that we triage the Tensions that are on the agenda that has been build.</p><p>You can express a Tension that is Tactical that comes from an Accountability of one of your roles (Governance).</p><p>For example: in my role "Speechmaker", where I have the Accountability to represent the organization and talk about Holacracy,&nbsp; I have the Tension that often their is no good sound installation on the venue's where I come. Therefore I want a Next action from the Role "Stuff we Need" to buy a portable speaker set for me.</p><p>So in both Tactical as Governance we process Tensions but also outside of these meetings you can express and process Tensions with other Roles.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p></dd>
