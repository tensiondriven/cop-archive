  <dd><p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>From my perspective, bringing up a slideshow to support a Proposal sounds like the proposer want to "sell" her/his proposal and argue about it.</p><p>Even if there is any explicit rule about the way of presenting proposal, using an external document is really strange and useless regarding the IDM process:</p><ul><li>Making a proposal is just completing the sentence "I propose that...‚Äù</li><li>Clarifying questions is the relevant place for other circle members to better understand the proposer's proposal,</li><li>During reaction round, any one is able to react freely to the proposal,</li><li>The proposer is able to amend and clarify her/his proposal,</li><li>Any proposal is supposed valid except if it will harm the circle or it is against the constitution,</li><li>Valid objection(s) will be integrated during the integration step.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seems it might be some shadow power acting behind this behavior...</p><p>Personally I wouldn't allow this way of presenting the proposal and I'd give some coaching point to bring the proposer back into the process.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
