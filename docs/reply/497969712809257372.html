  <dd><p>Hello Martin.</p><p>I go with Jean-Michel. Having a second person (the rep link) representing the circle is very powerful, specially at the beginning. Usually the Lead Link knows more about the circle health, and he or she is going to promptly report the metrics and checklists in the first tactical meetings. I like to encourage the rep links to report them instead (as the Constitution states), because it forces&nbsp;the elected person&nbsp;to know more about the whole circle. It also gives a sense that the LL is not the all-mighty manager anymore. It's cool <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>The integrative election process is very powerful and encourages more participation and involvement from the core roles. I suggest you do not skip that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
