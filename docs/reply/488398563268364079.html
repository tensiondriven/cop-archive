  <dd><p>@Paul: It's not an assumption - there is a rule for that <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>If you're acting&nbsp;to serve one of your roles, then you can take any action you deem useful to express its purpose or accountability (<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art13" target="_blank">article 1.3: Authority to Act</a>).</p><p>If you're NOT acting to serve one of your roles, then you may&nbsp;still act, but this would be considered an Individual Action, and there are some conditions for you to consider before and after taking action (<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art43" target="_blank">article 4.3: Individual Action</a>).</p></dd>
