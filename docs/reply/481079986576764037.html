<p>Eric,</p><p>In our context, the regulatory agency requires that we have 5 full-time faculty and that each spends at least the majority of their time in instructional related activities. They have, therefore, defined time as a resource that the college is purchasing from the employee. So, since federal laws define full-time as "30 hours per week or 130 hours per month," 16 hours per week or 66 hours per month must be allocated to duties related to the faculty role. It would seem, then, that in our case at least this amount of time is a resource and is to be directed. The remaining time is to be spent either in the faculty role or other available roles as needed.</p><p>I'm not sure if this helps or if it is in anyway applicable to your question. Still, its the line that we must walk with our regulatory requirements here at Likewise. If you see it differently, I am more than happy to entertain a different interpretation!</p>  </div>
