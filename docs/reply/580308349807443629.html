  <dd><p>[@mention:449693036223847456] Hi Brian, I just re-read your message and think I might've come up with a solution and was curious what your opinion was (with the understanding you are NOT a lawyer and we'd need to double check with an attorney for final answer)</p><p>We would set up a Delaware B Corp as parent company with subsidiary LLCs in the individual states we will operate in future.&nbsp; We were already planning on doing this on an event level (art/music street festivals) as this also helps from an accounting standpoint and asset protection strategy since if something goes wrong outside of our control, if someone were to pierce the corporate veil, we'd want that extra layer of protection.</p><p>Thanks in advance</p></dd>
