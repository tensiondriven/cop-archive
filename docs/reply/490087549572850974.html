  <dd><p>Question, as anyone questioned the existence of the circle itself? If there is really no need for LL-ing, then why have an additional circle? Making a proposal to dissolve the circle or re-shape it with the current context in mind could be a good way to get data about that. Distributing LL authority is one thing and possible;&nbsp;removing (not constitutional anyway) or not needing sounds like a symptom of something else needing to be processed.</p><p>Can't wait to read your Evernote&nbsp;doc Paul.</p></dd>
