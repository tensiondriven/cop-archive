  <dd><p>[@mention:588613650771009734], Thanks for your response. I read your words "It’s perfectly allowed to assign someone who is a circle’s Rep Link to its Lead Link role; it’s just not allowed to elect someone who is Lead Link into the Rep Link role.&nbsp; "</p><p>I also get the spirit of it that it will be a conflict of interest if we have the same person. My question is, now, is it categorically written any where in the constitution, the stuff that I have quoted you on above here?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
