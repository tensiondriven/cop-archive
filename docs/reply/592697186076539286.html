  <dd><p>[@mention:457575321027129860], thanks for your response. I see that it makes sense to educate the new partner to just tell the one or two words and not try to explain it. Here when both people are educated then there is less chance of things left out. i also like what you say around the agenda left out and the tension may still persist the person can still bring it up.&nbsp;</p><p>we are in an interesting phase as there are people who may be on the lower place of conventional strucutural power and they are now responding with more power when placed in a context where they have the voice and pathways. its liberating to see such shifts happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks again!</p></dd>
