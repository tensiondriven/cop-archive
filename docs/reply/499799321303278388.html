  <dd><p>hi all, thanks for these reflections! Fully agree that Holacracy fits all environments. For me it is all about making the transition happen. And support&nbsp;the relevant underlying behavior shifts that are most beneficial for a specific client to make so they get the full Holacracy experience.&nbsp;</p><p>@jean-michel: I might reach out soon&nbsp;if we can connect our two clients so they can share their experiences. PR advisors with theater actors. should be interesting anyway. I'll keep an action on my list for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Koen</p></dd>
