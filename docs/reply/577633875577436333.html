  <dd><p>Hi [@mention:493184366878843164]. I don't know if this will give you ideas about Lead Links allocating resources or not, but I would definitely say people's time <strong>is</strong> a valuable resource. The following webpage gives 5 links to really good research studies about using time as the only currency exchange and at least 4 of those 5 papers would give you valuable "proof" of the value of people's time. They will refer to timebanking in general, but also to a ton of rescue work that was done in New Zealand in 2010 and 2011 when they had 3 sets of huge earthquakes within 10 months of each other. The timebanks were literally how people got food, shelter, resources, and even rescue, when the government was overwhelmed and had neither the budget nor the number of people capable to do the work that needed doing.&nbsp; <a href="http://timebanks.nz/resources/research" target="_blank">http://timebanks.nz/resources/research</a></p><p>According to Economist Jeremy Rifkin who is a key advisor to several governments around the world (Germany, France, Luxembourg, China, and others) that are restructuring their economies to be more resilient and less hierarchical, we are rapidly headed toward world economies where money and hierarchy will no longer be the main mode of exchange, and that will be true in capitalist countries like the US as well, whether they want it to or not. If you can't watch the whole thing, start at 40 minutes. This was posted February of 2018. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOMLkqbFR5o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOMLkqbFR5o</a></p><p>Most of you on this Community of Practice will probably see this talk of Jeremy Rifkin's as applicable to why both Holacracy and lateral non-hierarchical sharing economies will be critical to the world economies in the near future. I believe it will affect the near future of all human beings on the planet.</p></dd>
