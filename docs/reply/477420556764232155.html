  <dd><p>I'm with Christel on the first sentence of the Testing Objections card and would make a couple of changes.</p><div>1) —&gt; Is this a reason the proposal causes harm or moves us backward?</div><div>(we are testing the objection so the word “this” naturally refers to the objection ,not to the proposal, in my opinion)</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>OR</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>2)&nbsp;is it a better idea, &nbsp;something else we should consider, or the proposal just feels unnecessary?</div><div>(there might be better wordings to this but the "unnecessary" word, which I heard&nbsp;Karilen use as an example of how to be creative with the options after the OR statement, would rule out a lot of not-so-well-grounded objections in my opinion.</div></dd>
