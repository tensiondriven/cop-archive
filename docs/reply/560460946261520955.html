  <dd><p>Hi,&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859],&nbsp;thanks for the answer!&nbsp;<br /><br />In the current structure these sub-circles are departments. Authorities for hiring employees, assigning metrics and expectations are at the head of the lower level, since the top-level manager can not effectively cope with these duties. If we create one common circle, these functions are returned to the top-level manager (lead-link), which will negatively affect the efficiency. Can the lid-link transfer these powers to any of the roles of the circle?</p></dd>
