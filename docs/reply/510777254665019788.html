  <dd><p>We do have some items on the roadmap to support integration, like web hooks and Zapier, so thank you for mentioning it! It helps me get a sense of its relative priority to other items on the roadmap. I'd love to hear any use cases that it would help you with so that I can understand what folks are trying to do and how they are using GlassFrog.</p><p>Related to your initial post, Xavier, I got the sense that you were looking for something more "report" like the query the api and get simple/readable results or something like that?&nbsp;</p></dd>
