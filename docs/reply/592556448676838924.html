  <dd><p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;- You can do it in GlassFrog, but it isn't the most obvious. If you fill the role, you should see&nbsp;a "+ policy" link next to the domain. This will just show as a "+" if there's already policies on there. Just click on that and it will open a popup for you to add the policy and it will notify the other circle members that you've put it on there. You can access it later either from the circle &gt; policies tab, or from the link next to the domain on the role page later.<img src="/fileSendAction/fcType/0/fcOid/592274973649815612/filePointer/592556448676838926/fodoid/592556448676838922/imageType/MEDIUM/inlineImage/true/mceclip0.png" /></p></dd>
