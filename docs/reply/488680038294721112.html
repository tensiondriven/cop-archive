  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>Good idea... But might be a little heavy if you add to the checklist as many items as they are accountabilities on the roles of the circle!</p><p>And what if there is any update needed about the pricing guidelines? "Check" or "No Check"? Actually, you may ask implicitly a role for an action as it is up to the role to decide at any moment the relievent action to be done.</p><p>Suggestion : just add "Review my roles and accountabilities" for each member of the circle... which is in fact the outcome you wish.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
