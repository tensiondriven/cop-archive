  <dd><p>Hi Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a funny one because to be valid, a tension has to be based on a specific situation where it limited the person's role.</p><p>I would be curious to see the concrete situation where it limited that new person's role.</p><p>If not, not valid to be processed!</p><p>By the way, “tension” is neutral in its original sense. People often confuse it with problems, negative things which is not. I think you lack pedagogy here - don't avoid that by changing the name, it is a great challenge to continue to use it as is and change people's mind and perception about it.</p></dd>
