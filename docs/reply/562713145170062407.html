  <dd><p>I don't see the link in how someone decides to run an organization and the labor law. You have an impact on each other. No roles, no functional work but still outside of Holacracy they need hire/fire policies and salary rules. If they don't have these defined he just has to come to work each day and sit at his desk doing nothing I assume (to avoid getting fired for not showing up and getting warnings).</p></dd>
