  <dd><p>Thank you Alexia</p><p>I think the major challenge with an early start start up is cash flow. Generally a startup will have less than five people and no cash&nbsp;(unless vc funded etc) for the first 6 months to a year which is long enough to see if the idea gets traction.</p><p>The previous Glassfrog plan was perfect for this and meant it could be adopted and then payed for when the company grew past 5 people as the cash came in.</p><p>Changing the starting price from free to paid for will I believe change the number of startups&nbsp;trying Holacracy.&nbsp;</p><p>Being fair - I think this is smart. As adopting holacracy is a real investment and $9 a month per user is a small price to pay for a solid and reliable governance system.</p><p>It may deter others from "trying" holacracy... as this is not a system to "try" you need to "do".</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
