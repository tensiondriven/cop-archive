  <dd><p>Thanks to both of you :-) Just to check I'll try to&nbsp;answer the original question myself. <strong>Please confirm/change/add sth.</strong></p><p><strong>1. What is the relation between resources and domains?</strong> (are the same?, are different and if so, how to clearly differentiate them? Maybe resources&gt;domains or maybe otherwise?)</p><p><em>There is no logic relation (=, &lt;, &gt; etc.) between RESOUCES and DOMAINS, as they&nbsp;belong to different categories.<br /> RESOURCES=THINGS (it can be a car, computer, www website, database, file, production machine etc.)<br />DOMAIN=PROPERTY or FENCE (such fence can be built around barely anything, including RESOURCES, but also other intangible beings&nbsp;like for example "processes" or &nbsp;"communication with a specific client")&nbsp;</em></p></dd>
