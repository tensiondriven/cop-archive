Instead, the Circle’s Roles may only impact its Domains if a Policy explicitly allows the impact, or, alternatively, by proposing the action using the Circle’s Governance Process, exactly as described above for exercising Lead Link authority."</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:455886150941203371], I'm curious about this last part of your answer, and this aspect of the Constitution. Could you (or any other wonderful member of this community <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> !) tell me the "why" of this limit about domains for Anchor circles without LL ? Was there a tension who brought to this ? Another aspect of my interrogation is : in an Anchor circle with LL, why don't we have the same limitation, what doesn't make it necessary too (some part of LL authorities ?) ?</p><p>I'm aware that the LL has an accountability about resources allocation : "Allocating the Circle’s resources across its various Projects and/or Roles" ; but that's an accountability, not a domain so that there is no exclusive control granted to the LL about resources.</p><p>And by the way, a connected questions I have : if in holacracy what's not explicitly forbidden is allowed, what does prevent any member in any role to spend money and make investments ? If there is no policy about it ? I feel sometimes inconfortable about that question when people ask me, knowing that the LL has no domain about it (and I can imagine why it has not). I wonder how you deal with it, guys.</p><p>Thanks a lot !</p></dd>
