  <dd><p>Thanks again Jeff. In that case getting values out in a way that helps others is much more of a shared situation. In a way they were already out there but not with the clarity we need. Which has become much more important as the team has grown.</p><p>Do you have a record of the values or a role that has an accountability related to values?</p><p>I will certainly report back as and when I start to make some headway....or alternatively with what failed and why!&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" /></p></dd>
