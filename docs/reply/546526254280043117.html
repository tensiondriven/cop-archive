  <dd><p>Isn't - when you go to the bottom of things - the reluctance to accept the Holacracy model about the fear of letting go of control (besides ego's not willing to let go of their status)? Besides that, it is always very easy to see the potential downside to a new model and neglect the downsides of the current model. So I would start by examining the downsides of the current model of the organisation, and reviewing potential changes to be made to solve these (tensions). What you will likely run into then is the fear of letting go of control. If the present management is not at ease with this, see if you can make small steps to experiment with it. Once they get more comfortable with the concept, Holacracy can be introduced.</p></dd>
