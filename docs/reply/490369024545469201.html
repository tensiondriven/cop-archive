  <dd><p>Thank you so much for the interest, feedback, suggestions, and everything else. It is awesome to see so much intrigue about our adventure! I created an Evernote document that details the entire process and all the Q&amp;As we have gotten. This should address every question I have seen so far.</p><p><a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s705/sh/47f720b4-c833-4739-a072-c28f1506cd2f/b9a8575c8ca1e6cfe2c2ee8d8210eb88" target="_blank">https://www.evernote.com/shard...e6cfe2c2ee8d8210eb88</a></p><p>Karilen, most of the Constitutional things you pointed out were already taken care of by the way we did it (as we didn't remove the LL). You did point out one thing we hadn't thought of, that technically the LL Role will always be filled automatically, so I just proposed something new in the Super-Circle to fix that and added those details in the Evernote as well.</p><p>Since there is so much interest, I may set up an open office hours thing that anyone can join in on if they are interested in asking questions, providing feedback, etc.</p></dd>
