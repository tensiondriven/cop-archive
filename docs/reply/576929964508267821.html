  <dd><p>[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;To your question "What would be lacking without Reaction Round?", I would say many things. One is a safe space for people to digest the proposal - some of us need to speak&nbsp;loudly to reflect on something. Another one is a safe space again for people who may feel some pressure, kind like&nbsp;some attachment to the proposal, to express the inner pressure they feel. Another purpose which is my favorite, is to help the Proposer by modeling/offering different pathways that may address the Proposer's Tension. And I'm sure they are more into it.&nbsp;</p></dd>
