  <dd><p>Hi Keith, I always explain the Objection Round as the round where the Proposer invites the other Partners to help him/her to see if the Proposal will cause the Organization no harm. So raising an Objection is a positive thing that invites the other Partners and the Proposer to have a critical look at the Proposal as is. This so we make sure that the Proposal will contribute to the evolving organizations Governance.</p><p>So by changing the mindset from an Objection to an Invitation I try to avoid the personal feeling of objecting.&nbsp;</p></dd>
