  <dd><p>What about inviting anyone who wants to talk about <em>how Holacracy in your organization,could be reducing happiness rates</em> .. keeping groups small or large, whatever it takes to make people comfortable about talking about what's behind this. It could be that people are just not comfortable with the clarity Holacracy enables? Holacracy can often be a scapegoat in company as well, for all problems. So getting to the individual "tensions" that exist is so important, for the case for continued Holacracy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
