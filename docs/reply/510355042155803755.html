  <dd><p>Hi Ruben,</p><p>What I learned during the training is that an objection is not invalid perse because you are anticipating something. If the possible impact is significant, anticipating this is enough of a reason for the objection to be valid. If it's not significant, you can just give it a try and see what happens. If it does have a negative impact, you can create a new proposal.&nbsp;</p><h4>3.2.4 Criteria for Valid Objections, c</h4><p>[...] However, relying on predictions is allowed when no opportunity to adequately sense and respond is likely to exist in the future before significant impact could result.</p><p>During training, Brian used the example of your neighbor working on a nuclear experiment in his basement. You would object to this because you anticipate nobody will survive an accident. So it's not safe to just try and deal with the &nbsp;consequences if and when they happen.</p><p>Cheers<br />Joni</p></dd>
