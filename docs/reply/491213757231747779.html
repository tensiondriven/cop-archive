<p>Stephen, re:</p><blockquote><p>If a new word like "tension" adds some nuance not present in a common word, then it's an important thing to keep; if it adds nothing but another word to learn, it's better to stick with a more common word.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with that completely; and I think tension adds a lot of key nuance. &nbsp;Most importantly, "tension"&nbsp;points to an experience - a feeling - where "issue" points to&nbsp;a thought - a mental construct. &nbsp;That's a <em><strong>huge</strong></em> difference when it comes to Holacracy practice and what it's trying to achieve. &nbsp;I think using "issue" is likely&nbsp;to undermine&nbsp;some of the biggest benefits&nbsp;Holacracy has to offer. &nbsp;(Although that might only be apparent and relevant&nbsp;if/when&nbsp;you get through the initial practice phase and&nbsp;to a more mature practice.)</p><p>As one example (and in disagreement with&nbsp;your last point): for most people, I think tension has a negative connotation - far more so than "issue". &nbsp;And that's the benefit of it. &nbsp;When people feel what Holacracy calls&nbsp;"tension", they typically then make meaning of that experience as a negative thing - they associate&nbsp;the feeling of tension meaning something is "wrong". &nbsp;Holacracy's use of the word tension - with its negative connotations - allows someone to see what happens as a result of tension through Holacracy, and eventually reorient their meaning-making of the experience into something neutral, and break an unconscious and habitual jump from experience to judgment to&nbsp;resistance. &nbsp;Associating the feeling of "tension" with&nbsp;useful results helps people shift from&nbsp;judging that experience and resisting the reality of it, to accepting it and engaging with it without judgment. &nbsp;That's a huge opportunity, and you don't get it nearly as powerfully if you start with "issue".</p><p>Curious if others have perspectives to add here as well...</p>  </div>
