<p>Thanks Brian. It seems to be more easy to understand if you're somewhat more used to the concept as a whole than me. I understand everyone works on his own and people are just linked to each other by commonly defined and agreed purposes and strategies but I also know the actual "counterwise" effect of e.g. budgets. If the LL assigns no budget to my projects&nbsp;I may start getting more active on those that have budget rather then raising a tension and trying to convince him (and the group) that it is in the purpose of our Joint venture to assign budget to my own project...</p><p>But I get your point - the lines I cited are not meant to be read the way I did - it's embedded in the concept as a whole and means that as per this role he should work on these things while assuring that the purpose of the circle is not harmed and this way conflicts should be solved in tactical meetings without pushing/assigning any tasks directly to anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Would love to see this in action, to practition this in real life...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
