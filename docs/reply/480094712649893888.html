<p>Hey Chris,</p><p>thanks for your input about DIY-material. I'm working in a team where we&nbsp;are about to start using Holacracy. Since we&nbsp;will&nbsp;be the only team in our organisation running Holacracy so far, we've already been thinking about how we could offer&nbsp;some teasers if anyone&nbsp;wanted to see what Holacracy is about. One thing, for sure, could simply be to invite them to a meeting or just show them how we work. Another thing we've been thinking about, is running a simulation for them so they can get an experience&nbsp;of Holacracy with their own stuff and tensions. Actually, it is also part of our job to deliver such simulations, since we are running a "Team Lab" where teams can learn how to improve their collaboration and even experiment new ways of working.&nbsp;</p><p>Long story short: If there is some simulation-material you can provide, we would really appreciate that. :-)</p><p>Daniel</p>  </div>
