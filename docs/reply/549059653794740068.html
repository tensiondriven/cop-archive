  <dd><p>[@mention:456167666726491228]&nbsp;I understand you've done an constitutional amendment for P&amp;P circle, in which this circle has no LL nor Rep-Link. To answer your question, you cannot remove the Rep Link assignment (in case it's already done) &amp; even if you hold a new election, GlassFrog doesn't allow for "unfilled". What you may do (it's what we've done with iGi) is to create a new P&amp;P Circle and repatriate all policies &amp; roles from the former P&amp;P circle - and of course leave "unfilled" both Lead Link and Rep Link.</p></dd>
