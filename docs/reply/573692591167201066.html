  <dd><p>I think you can find some compensation systems in the holacracy app store, as it sure is a question that's regularly raised (with good reasons).</p><p>Now, are you asking about compensation (ie. salaries) or property (ie. shares)?</p><p>On my end, I don't see a strict correlation between property and work in the organization. I could totally envision a company running Holacracy without everyone being a partner (ie. owning shares, concentrating wealth). That's also the beauty of Holacracy, is that you can use it to setup a dictatorship as well as a totally egalitarian "society", as long as anyone agrees on the rules (and knowing all that can change at the next governance meeting :-) ). For shares, I found the Slicing Pie system (<a href="http://slicingpie.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://slicingpie.com/" target="_blank">http://slicingpie.com/</a></a>) to be kind if neat.</p></dd>
