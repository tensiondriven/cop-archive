  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>3) yes, your questions are "constitutionally correct". I just mean that there is a nuance to how you make use of that questions as Facilitator. Especially in early stages, my experience is, we&nbsp;want to encourage people to bring their tensions and process them. If they feel "in front of the court" at their very first try it often results in frustration and stepping back from processing own tensions. And what I meant with the other thing was: as facilitator you can be asked by circle members to check the validity of the proposal and then I would raise those questions (also already at the beginning).</p><p>re "trusting the process": I have seen many IDM-processes where the a proposal not grounded in reality&nbsp;even if not tested in the beginning clearly reveals itself&nbsp;at some point in the process, e.g. during clarifying questions or seeking integration for example.&nbsp;</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
