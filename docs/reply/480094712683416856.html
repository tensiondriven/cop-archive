  <dd><p>Re: your second question: I think we (Structure &amp; Process, at that time called Röll &amp; Korvenmaa) had a structure like the one you image: There was an Anchor Circle (called "Board") which had Cross-Links for me and my business partner (and two more roles, for the partnership system and legal). Then there was the Rep-Link from the GCC, where the work took place. And of course, a Facilitator and a Secretary:</p><figure class="image"><img alt="Röll &amp; Korvenmaa Organisational Structure, March 2014" height="519" src="http://structureprocess.com/wp-content/uploads/140306-OrgStructure.jpg" width="800" /> <figcaption>Röll &amp; Korvenmaa Organisational Structure, March 2014<br />(taken from <a href="http://structureprocess.com/blog/holacracy-alltag-praxis/" target="_blank">http://structureprocess.com/bl...cracy-alltag-praxis/</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At this time, our Anchor Circle had no Lead Link. When this changed later, then indeed, the Lead Link&nbsp;became Secretary and the other partner the Facilitator (to avoid having the same person fill Lead Link AND Facilitator, which would be unconstitutional).&nbsp;</p><p>Does this help?</p></dd>
