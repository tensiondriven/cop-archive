  <dd><p>[@mention:590444326451884984]&nbsp;</p><p>We have not implemented badge system yet, but I was already thinking about&nbsp;same concer you have in a past. In my opinion one of the valid way will be to set a budget for compensation expenses, it can be dependant on turnover or other financial metric. Then it seems to me that there will be motivation not only to develop my self to get badges I am aspiring for and consequent compensation but to think about organization and their needs. I think that mechanism can support better self-orginized hiring/"firing" decisions as well.</p></dd>
