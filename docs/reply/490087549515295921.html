  <dd><p>Hey Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's a good idea!</p><p>We have this one as a monthly checklist: “Do monthly review”.</p><p>A monthly review is for us to review roles, accountabilities and policies - we have a policy stating that each partner must do a monthly review with a process clearly defined. The purpose of this is to make sure the governance is always up to date and reflecting the reality, not being obsolete.</p><p>If you put it as a policy in a governance meeting of the broader circle or the HR circle, you can put it as a checklist item.</p></dd>
