  <dd><p>Anne, for the past six months I have been LeadLink for the Volunteer Relations Circle of Likewise Inc. Having faced the situation that you've raised re. Projects and Roles, we've determined that the Individual Action output from a Tactical meeting allows a project to begin emerging. It may be that a role will need to be created later, but the immediate need is for a defined project to begin and for a clear person to head it up. Some projects are one-time-events and it doesn't make sense to go through a special Governance Meeting for such events. However, other projects once underway reveal the need for a special role of an ongoing nature. Meantime, the Individual Action allows the work to progress while the humans make sense of what is emerging as necessecary.</p></dd>
