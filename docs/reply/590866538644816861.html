  <dd><p>Thanks for your input.</p><p>Well, I don't think the Ratifiers have enough ongoing influence. They need a tool from outside of the Anchor Circle to set policies just like normally shareholders/board give direction to a company by giving goals to the CEO and other executives. And I think they need a tool that does not require them to get familiar with Holacracy or any other details on how the organization is run (after all, as a shareholder/investor you principally do not care - within reason - how the company you invested in is run in details as long as it meets your expectations in terms of dividend, share price increase or both, sometimes expressed in a financial roadmap with general product/service targets).</p></dd>
