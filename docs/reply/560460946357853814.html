  <dd><p>Geoff and Dick,</p><p>You two are great! &nbsp;Your replies clued me in that somethign must have been wrong on my end. I looked at the program and realized that "global metrics" were set by admins (me and my team) and that the checklist item was likely an artefact from when we were less practiced at holacracy. &nbsp;I had understood that "global metrics" were part of meetings as designed in glassfrog and not things created by our team. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for helping me to puzzle through that!</p></dd>
