  <dd><p>Isn't though this the&nbsp;point of good facilitation? You can't expect everyone in the organization to become holacracy masters, but you don't have to because if a facilitator is doing their job well, they make it their business to help people find the pathways to solving their tensions, whether they're the ex-CEO or the coffee stocker. As long as the org partners are comfortable bringing up their tensions they'd learn pretty quickly all the options available to them. A more experienced person might&nbsp;propose bolder changes but a good facilitator could make bold changes one of the pathways for a less experienced person. Isn't that how it should work?</p><p>(I'm in&nbsp;[@mention:577633875651499938]'s org and we are definitely in medium/early days so it could be I don't fully understand all the nuances)</p></dd>
