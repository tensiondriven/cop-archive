  <dd><p>Turns out there was already a similar thread before:</p><p><a href="/topic/prioritisation-duties?reply=491495232306760447#491495232306760447" target="_blank">...7#491495232306760447</a></p><p>We're doing it as if the duties are company wide, as opposed to just within the same circle. &nbsp;I guess to make it formal, we need to create a policy at the board level to amend this clause. Can I or should I do that ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
