  <dd><p>Hello Florent,</p><p>I see your point, and I do understand that in every company there´s a lot of unwanted work that has to be done. But the fact is that Holacracy won´t eliminate this unwanted work, it is just an operating system that helps you to deal with it.</p><p>By default, the Lead Link role has the authority to assign partners for the roles. So, if the Lead Link assigned someone, the Partner&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;the duty to process the Role, whether the Partner liked the Role or not. It´s his job. The Lead Link has the freedom to assign and unassign roles anytime, so you can choose to put a Partner rotation on this Role.</p></dd>
