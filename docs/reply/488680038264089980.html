  <dd><p>Hi Rob,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a functionality in GlassFrog (if you are Premium not free) that allows you to draft governance proposal and either bring them to a meeting or sent to all the core circle members. Once they receive it, they can select&nbsp;“No Objection” or “Escalate to meeting”.</p><p>Moreover, if you define a clear policy on top of what the constitution says about governance outside of governance meetings, you can configure your circle to accept all the out of governance proposals if nobody has clicked “Escalate to meeting” within a certain time (we've put 5 days).</p><p>Here is the video explaining how to do that:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQCBpwC4HWg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQCBpwC4HWg</a></p></dd>
