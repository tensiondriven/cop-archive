  <dd><p>Thanks for your feedback, everyone. &nbsp;My sense is that some people will feel we are moving backwards if we go with a unified project card view, and eliminate the list view. &nbsp;So, as UX Design for Glassfrog, I'm not completely sold on eliminating the list view, though I would really like to simplify our treatment of projects (and get basic personal system support into Glassfrog with the addition of Actions, but that's another story.)</p></dd>
