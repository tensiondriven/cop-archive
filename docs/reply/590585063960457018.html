  <dd><p>[@mention:577633875651499938]&nbsp;No, not as strategies. And it's definitely not something the Lead Link would care about (or I should say, I wouldn't expect the Lead Link role-filler to care anymore or less about it than any other role-filler).</p><p>I was talking about them generally, so you could apply that principle to formulating a strategy, but they aren't directly related.</p><p>I think the first place to look is always governance. It may not be enough, but defining expectations in governance should always be the first consideration. That's a critical point.</p><p>Now, let's assume that this isn't really a role thing like Chris consistently accepts meeting requests, but then just doesn't show up to them. OK, that's a Chris-as-a-person thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, let's say you'd like&nbsp;everyone to agree to have some sort of clearing conversation when an interpersonal tension arises. And that's just something you want the people to agree to (not the roles).&nbsp;</p><p>So again, and it's really important to get this, this isn't a&nbsp;constitutionally-governed type thing, this is something between the people as people.&nbsp;</p><p>With that said, the best way I know how to actualize the behavioral agreements in the people-space is to create some sort of ledger to make these agreements explicit. There are a few features:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Agreements are behavioral, i.e. not value, need, or principle-based</li><li>Agreements can be added, changed, or removed as necessary</li><li>An individual's agreement is voluntary and can be removed at any time</li><li>Agreements aren't necessarily for all partners&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now, this is kinda hard to explain in writing, so I just recorded a quick video explaination. I hope it helps!&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.useloom.com/share/ee08b90103624cafb133a31c1ea9301f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behavioral Agreements Ledger&nbsp;Video: High Level</a></p></dd>
