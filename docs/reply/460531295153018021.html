  <dd><div class="quoteHeading">Originally Posted by Carlos Zuma:</div><div class="quotedText"><p>Within the adaptation process from the old organizational structure to holacracy circles structure, we are struggling to allocate some teams in the circles, because these teams serve more than one role. Example: in the structure in a circle, a circle is responsible for counseling people (Care circle) and another is responsible for training professionals to counseling (Dissemination circle). Some teams at the same time, counseling people and train professionals to counseling. In what circle should we allocate such a team? One idea would be to allocate the team in one of the two circles and having a cross link to represent the other circle. Is this the better way? Thanks in advance.</p></div><p>Have you considered a cross link?</p></dd>
