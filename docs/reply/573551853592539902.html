  <dd><p>&nbsp;[@mention:564261722672205863]&nbsp;you're right in identifying the 3 roles that can add/change role fillers in GlassFrog as: Lead Link, Secretary and Admin.&nbsp; The Training role that you mentioned can certainly lean on these roles to update the role fillers.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Would you be interested in making a feature request for the Lead Link be able to grant the overall role-filling ability to another circle member in addition to themselves?&nbsp; I wasn't sure if the policy you spoke of was more specific than that e.g., only granting the ability for certain roles in the circle?</p></dd>
