  <dd><p>Hello&nbsp;[@mention:491495232183315418],</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p><p>I think you approach is applicable in some cases, will keep it in mind.</p><p>But I still have&nbsp;unclarity about tension/objection from a Lead Link, he then actually can object to any new accountability or a role, because he will think there is no competent person to fill it. But then&nbsp;solution will be to withdraw him from this role by Lead Link of a Super-Circle.</p><p>Ivan</p></dd>
