  <dd><p>HolacracyOne has a system called Attention Point System.&nbsp;<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/3628" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/policies/3628</a>&nbsp;</p><p>My organization Purely Poultry basically copied the Attention Point system. In our policy instead of 100 Attention Points equals a "full-focus partner" we say that 40 "Role Hours" equals a "full focus partner". We have a team member who works 15 hours a week. She has 5 roles. One role is allocated 1 role hour, another 5, another 3, another 2 and another role 2. &nbsp;We use a google sheet where these role hours are allocated.</p></dd>
