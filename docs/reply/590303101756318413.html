  <dd><p>I am an administrator in our GlassFrog account, but I *believe* that most users cannot create a project for other roles, unless they are acting as&nbsp;@Secretary during&nbsp;a Tactical Meeting.</p><p>So if that's true, the 'talk to them' part would be functionally required in order to get it into GlassFrog. OR I can bring it up during Tactical at which time it will be captured - whether the person who energizes the role in question is present or not.</p></dd>
