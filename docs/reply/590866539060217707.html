<p>I've found that most engineered solutions to circle structure (read: not based in an articulated tension) cause one or more of the following:<br />- people realize that it's not Holacracy for all, and it's demeaning...the person at the top is still just making decisions based on an old leadership paradigm</p><p>- the circle is less effective b/c the fiction of the creation becomes clear as they try to live out the purpose. Incongruencies abound and it's harder to get aligned on the work.</p><p>Convincing the people at the top of the food chain to work from a tension (firm on the tension and loose on the proposal) instills confidence throughout the company.</p><p>The short answer, is they can do anything they want but there is a cost to it.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
