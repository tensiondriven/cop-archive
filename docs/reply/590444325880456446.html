  <dd><p>Hello Shammi, if the LL feels that it is duplicating the LL can object based on the harm that it will decrease clarity for the Circle.</p><p>The objection that the LL can not find people is invalid. This about resources, in this case for the LL. This role has, according to the Constitution, the obligation to fill roles that are unfilled. So if this happens it is a Tension for the LL to address that their are not enough people to fill roles.</p></dd>
