  <dd><p>In addition to the other answers, the Constitution also&nbsp;notes that Lead Links can&nbsp;specially appoint additional persons.

This to ensure meetings are lead by an experienced Facilitator even if none of the "real"&nbsp;Circle Members have (yet) gained these skills.</p><p>Back to your question "Why is it best that facilitators are members of the circles they are operating in?" -&nbsp;I was not aware&nbsp;of Holacracy explicitly mentioning&nbsp;this as being "best" (as in preferred over a&nbsp;non-member). When a Circle has been&nbsp;under way for a while, it does feel like a natural thing to elect a core member as Facilitator, but that is not necessarily entirely the same thing.</p></dd>
