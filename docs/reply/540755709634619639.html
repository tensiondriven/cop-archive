It can stay as the “family property” until some tensions arise and you need to put more clarity by delegating part of the domain on a role for example or by defining a policy in the governance of the circle. In this scenario, it would no longer be the family property.</p></div></blockquote><p>I have had the same understanding, but this seems to be at odds with the Constitution. What am I missing?</p><p>v 4.1 section 2.2.2:&nbsp;</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 7"><p>A Circle’s Lead Link inherits the Purpose and any Accountabilities on the Circle itself, and <strong>controls any Domains defined on the Circle, just as if the Circle were only a Role and the Lead Link filled that Role.</strong></p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>I think you're referring to <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art221" target="_blank">section 2.2.1</a> and there is last sentence in this section that states : "...<strong>However, this only applies to the extent that those Accountabilities and Domains have not been placed upon a Role within the Circle, or otherwise delegated</strong>. Further, the Lead Link may not define Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles, except via the Governance Process of the Circle."</p><p>So in case Domains have been placed upon roles within the circle, they are no longer like *family property* nad cannot be impacted by Lead Link neither other defined roles within the circle.</p><p>Does this make sense?</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4></dd>
