Further, the Lead Link may not define Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles, except via the Governance Process of the Circle."</p><p>So in case Domains have been placed upon roles within the circle, they are no longer like *family property* nad cannot be impacted by Lead Link neither other defined roles within the circle.</p><p>Does this make sense?</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4></dd>
