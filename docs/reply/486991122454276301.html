  <dd><p>Dien, I wish you could come to one of our practitioner trainings. We cover a lot that you can't get from the constitution, including tricky objections which are often due to the fact that objections are a new distinction that we aren't used to.</p><p>For a resource allocation objection, you likely need to take a time out to explain the rules; even then if the person still wants to object, the facilitator has no authority to judge the objection or stop the objection.</p><p>Like Louis suggested, if coaching doesn't achieve the desired effect then you may end up integrating the objection, worse case scenario...</p><p>In fact re all of your questions, we practice in the practitioner training. Just failing to move the tension forward in some other way, or in any way is not actually an objection; there has to be an argument for harm. (My thought: who are we to know if the proposal won't do anything unless the proposer says this?)</p><p>If you just follow the process you could catch the majority of invalid objections, and even if you do not, usually the worst case is solving two tensions at once.&nbsp;</p><p>For tricky integration situations, we cover those rules in our coach training...</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>Karilen</p></dd>
