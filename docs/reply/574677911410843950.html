  <dd><p>Mikolaj,&nbsp; thanks for your ideas and request.&nbsp; &nbsp;Would it be sufficient to be able to go to a point in time and have GlassFrog go back to how the organization looked then (and then be able to choose another point in time, etc.)?&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new member of a circle or role I often review the history of these to get a feel for how things have evolved.&nbsp; I gather that you're looking for something a bit more visual?</p></dd>
