  <dd><p>To echo Margaux's point (and dodge the original question <img alt="" class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" />), there's a *really* good reason *not* to change it, especially when someone perceives it as negative and wants to change it... that's exactly the&nbsp;reason for the&nbsp;word tension, to evoke that sense of negatively and dislike, lean into it, and slowly rewire people's meaning-making around&nbsp;that experience itself...</p></dd>
