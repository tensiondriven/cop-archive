  <dd><p>Hi Anita,&nbsp;</p><p>The issue you're facing is one of the drawbacks with adopting Holacracy in parts of your organizations at a time. As you notice, there is no pathway for processing tensions between the two circles practicing Holacracy because they are not linked by any role.&nbsp;</p><p>Technically, each of your&nbsp;two circles is the Anchor circle for their&nbsp;Holacracy implementation. They would have a Lead Link but no Rep Link, because there is no broader circle.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want those two circles to have a channel to process tensions, using Cross Links is perhaps your 2nd best choice, by having each circle propose an internal policy inviting a Cross Link from the other circle. You would have two Rep Links, one in each direction.&nbsp;It's a bit quirky, but it would work.</p><p>Your 1st best choice is to adopt Holacracy at the level of the broader circle, and unlock the pathways for processing tensions between all those circles.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p></dd>
