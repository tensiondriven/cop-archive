  <dd><p>Likewise College is officially Holacratic as of November 1, 2016. We "sandboxed" for just over a year with a group of incarcerated students and another group of local university student volunteers. After taking our emerging distance faculty through a 6 week training course that centered on holacracy, I ceded presidential authority to the constitution. Likewise needs additional experience and exposure that this thread appears to offer. I really like the idea of a Google Hangout that brings lead links from our organizations’ anchor circles into a forum for advanced experience and support. The experience of running through a tactical that brings greater transparency to our community (and that helps us hone in on details like setting metrics, considering resources and priorities, etc) could prove beneficial as we work to grow holacratic practice and the benefits of self-governance in the world.</p></dd>
