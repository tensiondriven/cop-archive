<p>Keith,</p><p>The only rule I know is in Section 2.5.4 - As you know, you may use your reasonable judgment to interpret the Constitution.</p><h4><em>2.5.4 Surrogates for Elected Roles</em></h4><p><em>A surrogate may temporarily fill an Elected Role when one is unfilled, or when the person who normally fills the Role is unavailable for a Circle meeting or feels unable or unwilling to enact the Role’s duties.</em></p><p><em>In any given instance where a surrogate is needed, the surrogate is, in this order of precedence:</em></p><ul><li><em><strong>(a)</strong> someone explicitly specified by the person to be replaced; or</em></li><li><em><strong>(b)</strong> the acting Facilitator of the Circle; or</em></li><li><em><strong>(c)</strong> the acting Secretary of the Circle; or</em></li><li><em><strong>(d)</strong> the Lead Link of the Circle; or</em></li><li><em><strong>(e)</strong> the first Core Circle Member of the Circle to declare he or she is acting as the surrogate.</em></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me share with you my interpretation of the Constitution and my practice here. It has already happened quite several times that I would be both Facilitator, Proposer and Objector (to my own Proposal). It can work with some practice. The key issue for me is - do I feel emotionally attached to the Proposal or to the Objection? (In other words, is my inner space neutral) If the answer is No (I'm not attached) for both, then I know by experience that I can facilitate processing such Proposal as I have enough available energy and neutrality to do the job. If the answer is Yes to both questions, I know that&nbsp;I want to hand over the Facilitator Role for such Proposal from the beginning of such processing. If the answer is No for the first question but Yes for the second, I will facilitate until I raise my Objection and hand over the Facilitation for the resolution of the Objection.</p><p>Last tip, when I play with the three roles simultaneously, I would emphasize framing loudly in which role I do play right now (and may adding a new role in order to make some coaching points) - this helps me a lot and help the others too. If I have a cap, I will certainly use it for make it more fun :=)</p>  </div>
