  <dd><p>Yes&nbsp;[@mention:491073019777409299]&nbsp;I agree with you, creating a new circle has a cost. Your worst enemy when it comes to design structure in Holacracy is your *mind*. I like to look at circles as cohesive organs of the body of the org. with their own value chain and rate. My advice would be: 1/ Follow the tension (always) and 2/ if you've different options, try to get the one with the more cohesion and &nbsp;the lowest coupling within the holarchy.</p></dd>
