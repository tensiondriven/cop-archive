I've updated&nbsp;the guidance on&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/get-ready-for-the-tactical-assessment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">relevant webpage</a> to clarify this.&nbsp;</p><p>And to protect the integrity of the&nbsp;assessment we ask that these records are not shared with anyone else, as this would compromise the&nbsp;assessment for future candidates for the reasons given above.&nbsp;</p><p>Do let me know if you have any more questions or if&nbsp;I can be of assistance in any other way. I look forward to seeing some of you in your&nbsp;assessments!&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes, Nick&nbsp;</p></dd>
