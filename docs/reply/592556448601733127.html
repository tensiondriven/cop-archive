  <dd><p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;Ah! So, they do two different things. Domains prevent others from doing impacting/doing it without permission. But if you only had that, then there'd be no expectation that the Lead Link <strong>DO</strong> anything specifically with that power, which is why the accountability is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you imagine the accountability doesn't exist, only the domain, then as a circle member I could ask the Lead Link to take a project to fill a newly created role and the Lead Link could say, "Not my accountability." Then you could ask to impact the domain of "role-assignments," and you'd probably get the permission to do so yourself, but all of that is unnecessary because the intended expectation on the Lead Link is consciously and proactively consider assigning role-fillers to roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Does that make sense?&nbsp;</p></dd>
