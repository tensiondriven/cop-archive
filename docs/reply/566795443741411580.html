  <dd><p>I second Jean-Michel!&nbsp;</p><p>A negative accountability does nothing to limit anyone's power.&nbsp;It would still be <strong>totally</strong> legitimate for this role to say "in expression of my role's purpose, I am advising&nbsp;this person to leave the company".</p><p>Putting in place these kind of negative accountabilities I think would decrease my trust in the Holacracy system I was part of. "We say that anyone can do anything (AKA&nbsp;be a Ferrari), apart from things were domains and policies limit action - but yet here are the old implicit expectations which don't really have power but are creeping out to say 'yeah, you can do this, but it won't go well if you do".</p></dd>
