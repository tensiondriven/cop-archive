  <dd><p>@RUBEN @ SPRINGEST:&nbsp;about&nbsp;"various ways a circle can be formed", I meant&nbsp;criteria to group existing roles into sub-circles to maximize cohesion and efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree (and the client knows) that circle is created in GM.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation is that an organization slowly deploys Holacracy in different parts (previously departments) of the organization. Now an existing department starts implementing Holacracy and becomes a circle in the GCC. However, because there are existing jobs that are slowly transformed into roles, it becomes challenging to define sub-circles in that new circle.</p><p>Other variables are the organization has regional offices, and each regional office has similar roles performing similar functions, just in different markets.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the ways they consider grouping&nbsp;sub-circles is based on the region these roles perform and interact (cohesion, and pattern of interaction). This seems to work, especially when dealing with meeting scheduling and maintaining sub-circle cohesion. So each sub-circle has similar purpose and work toward that purpose in different region. Those sub-circles have similar roles with similar accountabilities.&nbsp;The challenge is there is a lack of flow of information and cohesion between roles doing similar functions in different sub-circles (in different regions) and between sub-circles within the super-circle. (This starts to sound like conventional satellite offices set-up).&nbsp;The Lead Links of regionally focused sub-circles represent those sub-circles at the super-circle level. Is this the good&nbsp;way to go? How's about those similar roles in different sub-circles? Shall they be grouped in a separate sub-circles so that they can have regular TM and GM to evolve their roles and the organization or can this simply be teams which have separate team meetings?</p><p>Another&nbsp;way they consider grouping a circle is to group roles that have closely related&nbsp;functions or purpose and have multiple multi-filled roles with different focuses in 1 circle.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess there are many possibilities to address this real tension. I am curious to&nbsp;hear more&nbsp;suggestions&nbsp;and what Holacracy's&nbsp;best practices would look like in this context.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Lily</p></dd>
