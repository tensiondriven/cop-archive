<p>In the case where the Secretary is too busy and needs to resign from the role is&nbsp;I've asked them if they wanted me to schedule a governance meeting on their behalf and call for new elections. I don't think there's anything that says Secretary has to be the one to schedule meetings, but I like to check to avoid conflicts. We then have the governance meeting as normal, using the normal proxy rules for acting secretary when secretary isn't there, and we start with the elections, or just do the elections if we can only have a short meeting. I typically have done this as LL&nbsp;since I'll have to do something about it at some point, but I guess any circle member could also do it, though I recommend communicating that you're scheduling a governance meeting as a proxy or whatever so that circle members aren't confused about what's going on.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
