  <dd><p>Hi Frederick,</p><p>That's an interesting question, especially since OKRs are gaining in popularity, especially in Silicon Valley. In my opinion there are a couple conflicts between Holacracy and the OKR philopshy. The first is in how OKRs are defined. OKRs assume the existence of a management hierarchy and OKRs are typically defined at the top and trickle down. I suppose you could define OKRs at the circle/role level instead, but as you mention that could become burdensome with most people filling many roles in Holacracy.</p><p>The bigger conflict is that the key-results of OKRs are targets to achieve by a certain date. They are an attempt to predict the future and there is an implied commitment that you will achieve 60-70% of the key results.&nbsp;This of course can create&nbsp;extra stress&nbsp;if the commitments are no longer realistic and sub-optimal prioritization if these goals are no longer the most important thing to be doing. Brian explores this topic in much more detail in his article&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1O1Zm0T" target="_blank">The Insanity of the What-by-When</a>. Definitely recommend you check that out if you haven't seen it.</p><p>-Eric</p></dd>
