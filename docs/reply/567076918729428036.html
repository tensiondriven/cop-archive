  <dd><p>Agree with&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;Holacracy is just a framework, *neutral* - there are a lot of misunderstanding &amp; confusion around that on the market with teal org. and "entreprise libérée" philosophy. I just had a conversation with a CEO taht&nbsp;was afraid of things that it thought should be required by Holacracy, which is absolutely not the case. The business and process content is still designed by those who run the business - no philosophy to absorb here as pre req.</p></dd>
