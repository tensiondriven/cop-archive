  <dd><p>Hi Stefan,</p><p>Based on our experience, this would be possible (we're going to implement Hol. in a 15p department of a 2500 people org.) , nevertheless I would recommend if possible to implement in a piece of the organization including at least 2 or more conventional hierarchical layers to get the benefits from Holacracy.</p><p>Here is an example with a pilot of 50 people in a 70 000 people group</p><p><a href="http://igipartners.com/en/testing-holacracy-part-large-company" target="_blank">http://igipartners.com/en/test...y-part-large-company</a></p><p>Of course you will not get the full benefits of Holacracy when applying in only a part of the whole org. but almost 60% based on what Dannon (another client) estimates.</p><p>Hope this helps</p><p>Bernard Marie</p></dd>
