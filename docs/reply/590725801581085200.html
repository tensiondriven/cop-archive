  <dd><p>Hi Allan and Isabelle,<br /><br />As GlassFrog Business Manager I want to reiterate how sorry we are that you ran into this issue -- we're pretty sure it was just a one-time bug as we switched from our old proposal builder code to the new code, so it shouldn't happen again. Thanks for your patience!</p></dd>
