  <dd><p>Hey Keith - I'd say it is already explicit in the Constitution; a "Policy" is defined as a grant or limit of authority. &nbsp;Are those things you linked to grants or limits of authority, or something else? &nbsp;If something else, they are&nbsp;definitionally not a "Policy" as the Constitution defines it. &nbsp;You don't need to rely on any instruction or anything else outside of the Constitution to take that stand. &nbsp;You don't even need to say "Policies can't require action" - just that "a Policy is a grant or limit of authority; if this is not one of those two things, it's not valid as a Policy given the definition in the Constitution"...</p><p>And by the way, this one does look like a valid Policy to me (maybe not a good idea, but it is a grant of authority for one circle to&nbsp;cross link into another): &nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343</a></p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
