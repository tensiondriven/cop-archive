  <dd><p>Dear Benoit,</p><p>we are a small company and name&nbsp;surrogates while absent. When naming substitutes this is accompanied with a written handover in our wiki. The extend of the handover between the role holder and the substitute is defined by the extend of the absence period.&nbsp;</p><p>From&nbsp;our perspective this applies best to 2.5.4 (a) of the constitution.</p><p>A possible voting upfront (which i have seen in other - traditional - companies) would (a) not be aligned with the constitution and (b) create some more administrative overhead in at least duplication voting efforts - which will slow down the development of a company.</p><p>Best Regards,<br />Oliver</p></dd>
