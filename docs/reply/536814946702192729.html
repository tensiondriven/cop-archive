  <dd><p>Hi Dennis,</p><p>I would suggest to stay "tension driven" and to let the Gov process clarify this issue.</p><p>What is the tension behind the proposal to create the role within the Sub-Circle? Is this proposal relevant regarding the grounded activity of the Sub-Circle?</p><p>Knowing that if there is any tension, the Upper-Circle may at any time either add a new accountability to the Sub-Circle and restructure the Sub-Circle by moving into it Sub-Circle the "offended" Upper-Circle role, or move out of the Sub-Circle the "offending" role...</p><p>Hope that helps,</p></dd>
