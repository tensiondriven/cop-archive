  <dd><p>[@mention:462501715201240916]&nbsp;I agree with Tom's comments above and will just add my own clarification, which is that "valid tension" is only meant in the context of "valid to be processed through Holacracy-specific pathways." So, "invalid tension," really means, "invalid tension to be processed in <em>this</em> space," whatever space that is.&nbsp;</p><p>Like if I wanted to talk to my wife about an upcoming trip, and she started talking about remodeling our kitchen. I probably wouldn't actually say, "THAT'S AN INVALID TENSION!" I would hopefully find a more appropriate way to clarify the intended purpose and scope of the conversation. That's all that means.&nbsp;</p></dd>
