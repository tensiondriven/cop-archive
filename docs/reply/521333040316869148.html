  <dd><p>Hi Mikolaj,</p><p>As a brief answer, occupational safety sounds to be a sensitive issue within your organization.</p><p>Just address this topic using Tactical and Governance meetings by processing tensions related to grounded safety issues, in order to:<br /> • Defining the needed roles and circles<br /> • Defining accountabilities related to safety&nbsp;<br /> • Adopting the requested policies<br /> • Developing the needed apps<br /> • Working on to projects toward occupational safety improvement<br /> •...</p><p>Holacracy doesn't change the content of the work and the way to do it; it only changes the way to&nbsp;take decisions about it...</p><p>As a first approach, just describe through Holacracy the way you work already; then make it evolve through Tac and Gov decisions.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
