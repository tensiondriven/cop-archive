  <dd><p>I don't have any materials for it any longer, but&nbsp;from memory, I can tell you that the project was to develop a clone of&nbsp;an old video game (I think it was something like Space Invaders or Galaga). &nbsp;It was actually for a game to be given away as a promotion in a cereal box for a new "Retro Arcade Cereal", but usually the team didn't actually ask the client for enough context to realize that until way late in the day, once they started to realize how little they actually knew of the client's real goals for the project. &nbsp;We started&nbsp;the scenario as "it's your first day of work, your boss is on vacation, but he left you this memo" - the memo told them&nbsp;what to build (which wasn't exactly what the client really wanted), and gave the client's name and phone number and said feel free to call the client with any questions (few people did until way later&nbsp;in the day)...</p><p>That's all I've got from memory; Lex played the client for us - she may remember more...</p></dd>
