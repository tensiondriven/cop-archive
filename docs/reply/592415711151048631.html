  <dd><p>Great.</p><p>Yes. We have Holacracy roles for each circle, who is accountable for monitoring the engagement in each circle (we call them Engagement Ambassadors).<br />The objective is simply to reach highest possible engagement, and to be able to know how we performance/improve on a weekly/bi-weekly basis, so we can react quickly, rather than e.g. only having quarterly/annual surveys.</p><p>In addition, we wanted to distribute the accountability for Engagement to each circle. Each role holder in the circles are informed weekly via email how&nbsp;their circle is performing, and all Engagement Ambassadors across all circle also meet on a regular basis to exchange best practices on how to improve engagement in their circles.</p></dd>
