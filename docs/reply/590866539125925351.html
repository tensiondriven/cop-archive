  <dd><p>This sounds good. So, when we are creating a tension in glassfrog and it asks what role does it connect with. If "partner" is an implicit role..i am cautious about that because if feels like a slippery slope that partners can make proposals. At the objection round, it does state specifically that "<span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it limit one of your roles? (which one), or are you just trying to help another role." If we go the partner route, it feels like a loop hole I don't want to open. because then they can run amok&nbsp;because a partner does not a role or an accountability. Not sure. I am curious about what others think.</span></p></dd>
