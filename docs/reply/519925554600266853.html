  <dd><p>I will add that an agreement that states what type of work an individual will do may be necessary... someone needs to take out the trash; so you may bring someone on for specific work such as administrative work, logistics, or&nbsp;software development for example.</p><p>You can build this into a person's core agreement (like an employment contract), and then they would have to take on those roles when asked to fulfill their commitment to the organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of what has already been shared relates to&nbsp;processing these tensions using Holacracy itself; try the Governance process to see what you can come up with in your organization to address the tension, like some members&nbsp;others have done.</p><p>(In our organization we have a process for providing other roles that fill roles when no one wants them, not only lead link to distribute that issue, and a process for prioritizing our attention across all our roles like the Attention Points Tyler is describing.)</p></dd>
