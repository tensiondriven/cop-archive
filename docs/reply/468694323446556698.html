  <dd><p>John, following your judgement of multi-level-circle, which sounds reasonable although I came across several instances where the option of re-structuring sub-circles and moving roles into it was kind of abused by powerplayers,&nbsp;I have two questions:</p><p>1. did you grant this authority by amending the constitution or a governance proposal?</p><p>2. if the lead link of the sub-circle has a major tension with that and rep link takes tension back to super-circle - can he jump circles as well if it refers to the changes made by multi-level up circles or does he need to take the longer path? wondering how you mapped this two-way road...</p></dd>
