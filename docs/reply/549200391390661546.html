  <dd><p>If I understand you correctly, the tension is that some participants in the organization still act/think like employees who require management. Like&nbsp;[@mention:508806870940037068]&nbsp;points out, Holacracy gives possibility through empowerment (i.e., imposing self-responsibility).&nbsp;<em>This is not for everyone</em> and some will need to opt out in order to make way for incoming participants that can better align with the self-governance culture from their start. In time, I think the claim that practicing Holacracy helps transform those who are willing to submit to the call for self-leadership proves true. Still, for many humans, there is a huge gap between being led and having a self-leadership mentality.</p><p>One way we with Likewise address developing self-leaders is through guided reading and discussion group interactions. Some people (I'd say&nbsp;<em>most</em>) simply have no concept of self-leadership and need exposure to the rich history of literature that supports this contemporary self-governance movement. From our work with prison inmates and exposing them to the possibilities/blessings of self-governance/leadership, I'd say that your regular run-of-the-mill "employee" could stand to benefit from a similar community learning experience.</p></dd>
