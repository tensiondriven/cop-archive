  <dd><p>Hi Andrea</p><p>I've been hosting a Responsive Org Session about B-Corps in Zurich, inviting Jonathan Normand, from Codethic SA, Lausanne, the Swiss certification entity for B-Corps. I compiled a blog entry out of it :&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://zurich.impacthub.ch/de/responsive-organization-meets-b-corporations/" target="_blank">https://zurich.impacthub.ch/de...eets-b-corporations/</a></p><p>In this article you may find a number of links to publications and resources. I hope you could find it useful.</p><p>After attending to the reading, I can tell there was no explicit mention to Holacracy, although&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;of terms and principles are shared.&nbsp;For sure, being an Holacracy based Org helps to comply with the B-Corps assessment process, while defining purpose and accountabilities of the organization, for instance. On the other hand, other aspects requested in a B-Corp assessment, such as compensation and finance, are not covered explicitly in Holacracy, unless you have your "apps".&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p><p>Piero.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
