  <dd><p>I also find that helping humans adapt to this change is&nbsp;generally a better strategy than "fire them"... and, it sounds like some of the issues Keith is wrestling with may be&nbsp;beyond the normal&nbsp;change stuff, and may&nbsp;be indicative of more business discipline/rigor&nbsp;needed for the organization (with or without Holacracy at play).&nbsp;&nbsp;That's often the case with many non-profits in my experience; they tend to be better than most at&nbsp;building a culture that offers&nbsp;emotional support for the people, and worse than most at building a culture that&nbsp;offers&nbsp;business discipline/rigor for the organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;That may be completely off in Keith's case - and I didn't actually read his original post, so I'm responding solely to his last post above.&nbsp; But&nbsp;that last post left me with a hunch that what his organization needs most may not be better emotional support for struggling humans, or even Holacracy coaching of any sort, but just more traditional business/performance focus and discipline.&nbsp; Keith, does any of that resonate?</p></dd>
