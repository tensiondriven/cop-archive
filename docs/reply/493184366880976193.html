  <dd><p>Hi Jenn,</p><p>In my understanding so far, I would say the right question here is not "how many is too many accountabilities", but "how many accountabilities the circle member(s) filling this role&nbsp;is(are) able to truly enact" ?</p><p>If people feel overwhelmed or lack clarity for traking tensions, projects and next-actions, then the role may be split either in Focus (multiple people filling the same role, each of them being&nbsp;assigned to&nbsp;a clear focus) or the role may become itself a sub-circle of the current circle it belongs to.</p><p>Both cases may be treated&nbsp;in a Governance meeting of course.</p><p>In this last case, the sub-circle would split up in multiple roles as a self-organized entity, with its own governance meetings too.</p><p>Hope I'm right and it helps you.</p><p>Cheers.</p></dd>
