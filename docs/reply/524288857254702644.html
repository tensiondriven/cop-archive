  <dd><p>Thank you for your input, Bernard Marie and Brian. It is very short and definitely doesn't allow for the amount of&nbsp;framing necessary to guide novices through a simulation such as the one in a taster workshop. I was considering, if it could work to use a heavily scripted scenario, but without the required framing it really doesn't make any sense.</p><p>Appreciate your feedback! Thanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
