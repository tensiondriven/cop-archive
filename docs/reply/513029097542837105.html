We have a feature request to help with&nbsp;emailing all Facilitators, Secretaries, etc, and I've (as Product Manager) prioritized that higher to see if we can get something sooner to meet that need.</p><p>I'm curious what you had in mind for a simple query tool, or if you know of an existing functionality that does what you had in mind?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Lex&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi Alexia, sorry for my late answer. Indeed what I have in mind is being able to get simple answers from simple queries like an extract of all facilitators with their circle and email, or all empty roles for instance. We'll go with the API if there's no existing simple query tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks !</p><p>Xavier.</p></dd>
