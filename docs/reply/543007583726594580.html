  <dd><p>Hi Laura,</p><p>Interesting topic... knowing that Holacracy do not "manage" people! Holacracy is just a way to organize the work to be done. Then, people are free to enact their role just as they decide to do it.</p><p>Though, regarding their own "needs", people might be more or less comfortable when working in a company running Holacracy. Is that your research topic?</p><p>Regards.</p></dd>
