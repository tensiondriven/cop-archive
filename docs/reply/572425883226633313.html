<p>Great question&nbsp;[@mention:562150194299319857]&nbsp;. We have a process, but I'd say its a work in progress. Part of the onboarding process is a whole section of readings, videos, articles, gifs etc. We also have the new hires sit as observers in both meetings at the first 8 weeks. I then take time right after the meeting with them to answer any questions while they are fresh in the brain.&nbsp;</p><p>I find that since the jobs page has a few links to Holacracy intro videos and we also ask interview questions related to the mindset required, we haven't yet had someone who isn't excited or someone who makes huge mistakes. Sure there are missteps, but we all do it, and we learn from them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
