  <dd><p>I can certainly see Ruben's point and agree politics should be avoided as they do not align with the system. What I refer to is a sincere offer to remove a barrier to completion. In both organizations where I have operated in Holacracy, we have processed the tension of feeling overwhelmed, needing more time in the day, or not being able to prioritize an important project because the specific expertise needed for completion was held by a busy partner with non-emotional offers to help. It's the same thing that would happen if someone is out sick and the lead link surfaces a tension about too much to cover since temporarily unfilled roles. They ask for help and others step in as partners to process the tension.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that clarifies my perspective a little.&nbsp;<img alt="" class="noBorder" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p></dd>
