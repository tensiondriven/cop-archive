  <dd><p>Hey Keith,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think a lot depends on how close the relationship is; if the contractor is long-term and very&nbsp;close to the organization and its purpose, then I think it'd be really interesting to experiment with making them a partner. &nbsp;Of course be careful - Margaux's experience is a fair warning - but I have a hard time believing it can't possibly work, and it seems like there are some real benefits if it does, at least if the contractor knows or learns how to use Holacracy to help drive change effectively...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
