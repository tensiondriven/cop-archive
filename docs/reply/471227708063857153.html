<p>Hi Rebecca,</p><p>Thank you for your thoughtful post,&nbsp;it is greatly appreciated. I know it takes time and energy to compile feedback like that, and it is a gift to hear what folks think about GlassFrog. I'll forward it over&nbsp;to the&nbsp;role that decides about the business model. As GlassFrog Product Manager, I will keep on my mission to make sure GlassFrog is providing value.</p><p>I can appreciate that for a smaller company, a $45 increase can feel different than for a larger company. I can say&nbsp;that when we ran the numbers, we saw both price increases and decreases across the spectrum of company size. &nbsp;Of course, it remains to be seen what option organizations right at the edge of the current free plan choose to move to. &nbsp;And that obviously doesn't change your experience.</p><p>In any case, I appreciate that you are continuing with GlassFrog on the new Premium plan, and if you think of any features (besides what you posted already!)&nbsp;that might make GlassFrog better for the little groups, please feel free to reply to this post and I'll take notes. I'd love to hear them!</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Alexia</p>  </div>
