  <dd><p>Last piece</p><p><strong>* Why is there one cross link? I expected two cross link. one in the target cirlce and one in the linked entity.</strong></p><p>There is only one Cross Link which is in both Circles just like a Rep Link is both in Super and Sub-Circle. GlassFrog does not have right now a specific feature for addressing this mechanism, so when you want to create a Cross Link(and I would recommend to do it on purpose as creating a Cross Link Role has a cost from a design perspective) you have to create a Policy and 2 Roles, one in the Linked Entity and the other in the Target Circle.</p></dd>
