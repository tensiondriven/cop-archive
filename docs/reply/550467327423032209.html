  <dd><p>Love it! The only thing I might add, would be some more explanation of "why" this step is so focused -- especially if people rightly recognize the value of discussion and brainstorming, so they don't understand why this first step is just focused on the proposer.</p><p>So, in those situations, I usually say something like, "this whole process is a form of discussion and brainstorming. So, to get things started, we need to know 'what would YOU like?' Don't pre-filter yourself. And if you're not sure what would solve your tension, no problem, open for discussion now to help you get the starting proposal."</p></dd>
