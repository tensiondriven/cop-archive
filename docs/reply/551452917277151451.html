  <dd><p>I have always thought that this is to allow others to also schedule meetings without having explicit permission from the secretary. Although if the intent was to distribute authorities, this doesn't seem to do it.</p><p>The same question I guess holds for the Lead Link as well. &nbsp;The Lead Link's only domain is "Role Assignment within the circle". The LL does not have strategy, or budget, or metrics domain, only accountabilities.</p></dd>
