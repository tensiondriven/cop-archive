  <dd><p>It's great getting these ideas and work-arounds using Holacracy principles in ways that serve the greater purpose! It is showing me how the approach can be flexibly applied with a lightness of touch, when appropriate, moving up the levels where and when necessary to the full gamut of disciplined methods.</p><p>I agree that not everyone needs to know Holacracy to be a valid (and validated) volunteer. In the More To Life organisation we have Trainers of different kinds, and each of them has accountabilities (in the pre-Holacracy sense of the word).
