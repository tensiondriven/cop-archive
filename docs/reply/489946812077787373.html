  <dd><p>Paul,</p><p>It seems you are making a Role vs. Soul mistake? In your answer you describe your Lead Link as a person ("when our Lead Link resigned", "not much needed to be done as a LL"...). You also mentioned "do it in a way" which is about the way in which the role is energized. That's not governance, that's tactical, methinks.</p></dd>
