  <dd><p>A best practice from my 7+ years of Holacracy is to define a clear membrane for any circles - which means a Purpose and Domains so that everyone may know for anything coming in, is this is inside or outside the circle. If this is not in place, many tensions are going to surface and the holarchy would not be easy to work with.</p></dd>
