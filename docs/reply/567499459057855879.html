  <dd>The only thing I'd add to what Chris said, and to echo one of Tom's points, is that in a company of 5, start with one circle. I have never seen a good case for doing otherwise - it just adds complexity and extra meetings to schedule and hold to do otherwise, and will get in the way of your Holacracy practice in a major way. Too many circles is among the biggest pitfalls I see for small orgs adopting Holacracy DIY; scrap those circles (and likely a bunch of those roles), and you'll be far more likely to make and sustain the shift to Holacracy. Hope that helps!<br /><br />- Brian<br /><br />&gt; On Oct 23, 2017, at 4:23 AM, HolacracyOne &lt;<a href="mailto:alerts@hoop.la">alerts@hoop.la</a>&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; <br />&gt;</dd>
