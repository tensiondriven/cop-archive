  <dd><p>Hey Davi,</p><p>1) &nbsp;Yes, and it's not necessarily bad practice - it's a common and recommended thing to do in many cases. &nbsp;Sometimes, because a role&nbsp;controls a&nbsp;domain or works in a general&nbsp;area, others need&nbsp;to count on it for something so that they can get their purpose met, and that's just fine. &nbsp;On the other hand, it is often&nbsp;bad practice to stick extra accountabilities on a role&nbsp;that don't serve its purpose and that don't&nbsp;naturally&nbsp;fit that pattern.</p><p>2) &nbsp;Yes, it's allowed, and often&nbsp;quite natural - just because another role controls the domain doesn't mean you can't just ask them for permission or propose some accountability on them to get your own accountability met. &nbsp;Can you raise a valid objection to it on the grounds you've cited? &nbsp;Maybe, or maybe not - depends on whether you can answer the objection test questions and validate the objection...</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
