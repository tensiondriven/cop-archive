  <dd><p>There is also the possibility of getting some of the materials we (H1) use during the Taster workshops. I say "possibility" because I'm not sure what roles would take this on, maybe even one of my own. I know we've provided simulation materials to our implementation clients. Is that what you were thinking about?&nbsp;</p></dd>
