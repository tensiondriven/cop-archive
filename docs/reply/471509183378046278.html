  <dd><p>Hi Alexia</p><p>Yes Glassfrog needs to be the entry and simple storage of the task text and rudimentary info like "Action / Project / Trigger" etc.</p><p>Currently we take this and copy to our internal systems (Trello / Slack /Product Board ) for actioning.&nbsp;</p><p>What would be great is the following.<br /><br />For API:</p><ul><li>Add projects / tasks into Trello / Slack / others to create cards for organisation transparency (Cv4.1 1.2.3 &amp; Cv4.1 1.2.4)&nbsp;</li><li>Add projects / tasks into OmniFocus or Wunderlist etc for our personal tracking</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For Glassfrog visibility:</p><ul><li>Allow Tasks to be linked to existing projects (within Glassfrog)</li><li>Maintain an active link from Glassfrog to the task system - So you can link from Glassfrog to the task easily.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As this is premium features the user should be able to see linked tasks in the meeting history and in a personal Project and Task list. &nbsp;Maybe add tasks into the Project list as an option. You could also add a tab next to projects called My roles Projects and Actions + my personal actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just a thought</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tony</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
