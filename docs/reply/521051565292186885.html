  <dd><p>To add on Jean-Michel's comment, very often new practitioner may object for instance to the addition of an Accountability on a Role because of lack of ressource. This one is difficult to test by the 4 usual questions. The reason is that that participant may not have understood clearly what is an Accountability, which says nothing re the ressource to allocate. So I would give when such Objection occurs, a coaching point to help the Circle understand the meaning of an Accountability.</p><p>And it's not uncommon to Object (validly) when such Accountability triggers some bureaucracy/waste/muda - and this one is absolutely valid even if related to operational ressources.</p></dd>
