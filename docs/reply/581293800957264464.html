  <dd><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">We onboard our incarcerated students like this to help them leave behind unhealthy submissive habits and move toward healthy self-leadership:</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">The mission is what's going on daily ... next actions stated properly should do this (stated as accomplished for a simple True/False response).</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Vision is how it ought to be for a while ... accountabilities that adjust as needed can express this perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Purpose? That's the long-range picture that reminds you why its worth all the BS that we entrepreneurs have to put up with.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">We ask our students to think one step further out: destiny. Why do you exist?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Why will it really matter whether you accomplish your purpose? Knowing that makes it easier to adjust your Vision when necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Knowing that makes it easier to knock down your extractions like a beast. And knowing all of this, and putting it into practice consistently, makes it easy to breeze through a day not even realizing that you're outperforming yourself day after day.</span></p></dd>
