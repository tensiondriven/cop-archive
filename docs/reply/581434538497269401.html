  <dd><p>Hi Keith, The way I understand your specific case, it looks like you have an authority conflict&nbsp;between two roles. Yes one of the LL's accountabilities is allocating circle's resources, but you can change that. For instance if you want the expenses to be validated by another role, you could remove this authority from the LL and give it to that specific role, through a policy.</p><p>But maybe I did not understand your issue. Does it help ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
