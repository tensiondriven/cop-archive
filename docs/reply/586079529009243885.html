  <dd><p>[@mention:585798053992261976], this issue illuminates one of the myths of Holacracy. Holacracy is often said to eliminate hierarchies, but it doesn't. Holacracy changes the nature of hierarchies, their composition, but hierarchies remain a core part of Holacracy.</p><p>Domains articulate scopes of authority that are delegated from the GCC to Roles and Sub-Circles. But any scope of authority is derived from the root of all authority in the organization. That authority devolves from the Ratifying Authority, through the Constitution, to the GCC. Before any Role in any Circle can exercise control over a Domain, there must be a clear trail of scope of authority, <em>i.e.</em> Domains, from the GCC, through all intervening Sub-Circles, to the Role.</p><p>Your practical question reveals much about the abstract underpinnings upon which Holacracy rests.&nbsp;But I'm waxing philosophical. I'll stop now.</p></dd>
