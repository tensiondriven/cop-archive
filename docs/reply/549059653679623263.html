  <dd><p>Thank you, Tom!</p><p>Does that mean for 1 Cross Link, we will need to do the followings?&nbsp;</p><p>1). A circle creates a "Cross Link Policy"&nbsp;</p><p>2). The Linked Entity creates&nbsp;a Cross Link role in its circle, EX of naming: "Cross Link to X" where X is the Target Circle</p><p>2). The Target Circle creates a Cross Link role in its circle, EX of naming: "Cross Link from Y" where Y is the Linked Entity</p><p>3). Both of these Cross Links roles in the Linked Entity and the Target Circle will be filled by the same role-filler.</p><p>As for step 1, do both Linked Entity and the Target Circle need to create the "Cross Link Policy" or does the Super-circle create that "Cross Link Policy" that will apply to both of its sub-circle?</p><p>As I asked this question, I think the answer is it depends on whether both Linked Entity and Target Circle are sub-circles of one Super-circle or not. If they are not, the the former is true, isn't it?</p><p>Many thanks,</p><p>Lily&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
