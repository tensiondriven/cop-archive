  <dd><p>Hi Koen,</p><p>I faced a similar challenge in a product development company full of millenials and designers. That is a fact: they usually complain about the strict process. I found that a good solution is to offer them the benefits of&nbsp;the rules. That is, explaining that the process gives more space to&nbsp;the individuals for solving their own problems through experimentation. I usually explain that the IDM process is not a brainstorming, because we want to quickly put the proposal into practice and test its effectiveness through trial and error.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope it helps you <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
