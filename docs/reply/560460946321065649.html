  <dd><p>Cheers,&nbsp;[@mention:546244779278352720]!</p><p>I’d love to pick your brain, for sure, as I experimented with a lot of this tricky balance between how much to include of Holacracy and still keep to a fun and challenging game (without players getting too bogged down).</p><p>In regards to emergent play, as the Holacracy practice allows practitioners to be very creative around processing their tensions, there was further tricky balancing between&nbsp;“letting people create stuff by themselves” vs. “draw predetermined cards and make creative co-op solutions around these.” The last section in the&nbsp;<em>3. Methodology</em>&nbsp;chapter in the thesis document covers this process with tons of referrals for details in the appendices.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve got the chance, drop me your email and I’ll send you a Dropbox link with accompanying Typeform survey to gather&nbsp;play-testing feedback.</p></dd>
