  <dd><p>I have no practical experience of the situation, but I am a bit puzzled by your question. The legacy systems apply, so the question is: how has the organisation done firing/departure from&nbsp;the company in the past? (And then, secondary: why has it not built up systems to do that in its current Holacracy structure?)<br /><br />Do get in touch if you (or your client) would like some more in-depth exchange about your situation! I'll be happy to put my brain to it together with you.</p></dd>
