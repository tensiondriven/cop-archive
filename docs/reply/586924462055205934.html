  <dd><p>Love your comment&nbsp;[@mention:451241754031062437]&nbsp;I think a key insight here when it comes to design structure is to pay attention, take care of employee experience. Which should be common&nbsp;sense as Holacracy is really a tool available to employees, i.e. at their service and not the other way around. Structure design should be guided by human experience.</p></dd>
