<p>Very interesting topic, I still cannot get my head around the badge system as a whole, in pyramids you basically brake up salaries in a fixed way because most people are trapped in hoping they will make a leap the organization is designed to impede in the first place... (until they leave and new "salary increse dreamers" are recruited)</p><p>With badges the game at play is different, &nbsp;I have always asked my self, how you make sure that the&nbsp;count of badge attribution clearly reflects the hability of the company to make enough money to repay the salary disbursment they require as per their definition?</p><p>To my understanding by reading H1 governance policies the base salary is still tied to a set of badges. i guess the first badge set defined buy the compenastion architect would then determine the first salary range, but still the initial question remains unanswered how does he &nbsp;decide&nbsp;&nbsp;and adjust &nbsp;the proportions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
