<p>Very interesting discussion and right on the spot where I think the Holacracy coach as an unexperienced change consultant will lack tools to first understand the problem going on and second to do something with it. Ok, it is not in your role as a coach but it would be of great help. Organizations that don't start from the scratch with Holacracy already have a history and culture that may or may not be helpful. The old system will always pull back, the single individual can't change that. But Holacracy can be a good help to change it (as mentioned already above). What I advise the Holacracy coach/facilitator to use yourself as a tool and try to find out if somewhere in yourself you can feel the same kind of anxiety or fear as the practitioner mentioned by @Keith Jarvis. Use this feeling as a tension at the agenda, ask information: Does anyone recognizes this feeling now or in the past? There probably are more circle members having experienced this anxiety. From there you can start to build a solution, f.e. extra training, coaching, ...</p>  </div>
