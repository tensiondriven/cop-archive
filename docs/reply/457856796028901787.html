  <dd><p>Hi Rebeca,</p><p>My experience is that it helps in the beginning to use tima outs, so the members can learn the Holacracy &nbsp;"rules".&nbsp;However after a few meetings it can get anoying. We decided after 3-4 meetings to&nbsp;use the check out for feedback on the process. This brings the meeting in a more natural flow and gives opportunity for the members the follow the facilitator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Christel</p></dd>
