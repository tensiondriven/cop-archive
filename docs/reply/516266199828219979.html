  <dd><p>Maria,</p><p>We are doing Holacracy at WaTech in Washington State. We are currently doing a year long monitored experiment with Mike Lee of Harvard Business Review, and you might be interested in looking up some of the information provided by Mike, Harvard, or his study. We are only a few months in , so results are still forthcoming, but he is an excellent resource for Holacracy and process. Let me know if you need his contact information or any further help!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faith</p></dd>
