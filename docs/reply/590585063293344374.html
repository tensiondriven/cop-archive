  <dd><p>I also do not see the reason for not allowing someone abstaining.</p><p>There are colleagues that vote on&nbsp;names that do not exist just because they do not want to vote, which is the same as abstaining.<br />How are you going to force a colleague to cast a 'real' vote? It is just not possible.</p><p>Maybe the idea is to avoid someone pressuring peers not to vote?<br />There might be extreme situations when that could occur and maybe this rule is for those exceptions?</p></dd>
