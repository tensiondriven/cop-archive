  <dd><p>We have something similar in Holland, though there's precedent here for being exempted from the applicable law in certain cases. The precedent applies to organizations running with sociocracy, but I'd be confident it would apply as much or more to organizations running with Holacracy. The point being that Holacracy builds in something that you could almost call a 'distributed work(er)s council', although in reality&nbsp;it actually challenges the assumptions underlying those ideas in the first place (worker representations, power hierarchies, etc.). I look forward to seeing the first Holacracy-run company go up for the exemption, which is likely to happen soon!</p></dd>
