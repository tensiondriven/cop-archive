  <dd><p>I think Dennis is right - it depends on what kind of process breakdown. If from a failed Governance process then the circle facilitator declares and addresses.</p><p>I haven't seen this play out (yet) where there is a type of process breakdown and no one able to address it.</p><p>You could install an out of the box policy allowing others to also declare process breakdowns perhaps (like the Anchor Circle Secretary or any member of the Anchor Circle), or you could wait and see if it is an issue, and then propose something potentially even more relevant to address the real world case.</p></dd>
