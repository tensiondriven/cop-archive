  <dd><p>One lingering challenge for constitutional forms of governance is a reliance on the people to protect their rights, which requires understanding the blessing of those rights. We at Likewise College are developing a college level, discussion based course that explores the reasons for constitutions and the reasons for failure during the past 50 or so centuries. I believe a lite version of that course could help h Holacratic teams better understand the need to object in order to protect everyone involved and to get to know one another while developing self-leadership capacity.</p></dd>
