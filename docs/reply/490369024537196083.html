  <dd><p>One other thought -- if you've literally delegated all functions to every role in the circle then each role has the autocratic authority to act like Lead Link in my view, so wonder how that would work in your circle, Paul... thoughts? So I can simply assign someone to a role, as if I were LL, or set a priority as if I were LL, etc, unless a clear process saying different has been defined.</p></dd>
