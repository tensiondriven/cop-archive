  <dd><p>Hi Fred,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That feature is only to capture tensions to bring to governance so when in a tactical meeting you identify something you need to process in a governance meeting (for instance an implicit expectation that need to be explicit in governance with a clear accountability), instead of taking an action “Bring to the next governance meeting...”, you can just select “Tension” and put the content of the tension so that the tension owner will have it directly in his governance tension list, free to prepare (or not) the tension.</p><p>So it is only for governance tensions. I hope GlassFrog will have a list for tactical tensions as well soon.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
