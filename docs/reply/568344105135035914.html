  <dd><p>Hi all <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>My&nbsp;interpretation&nbsp;is that they are timeboxed but based on&nbsp;the arrangement by the secretary who schedules the meetings. So the timebox is known in advance and should not be crossed. When there is no time cap&nbsp;it's fairly easy to relax the process during tension processing.</p><p>We&nbsp;could always have a tension about having longer meetings in default but I we would do it starting from next meeting so to keep the discipline (similarly to the approach in SCRUM) and just call a special meeting in case something important is at hand.</p><p>So, Andrew why the question anyway? Did you experience any tensions during the meetings (too long or smthng.) or pure curiosity?</p><p>Thanks and best regards!</p></dd>
