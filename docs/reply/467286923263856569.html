  <dd><p>I am grateful for the responses and in-depth dialogue here.</p><p>I think in the instance the Brian describes, trying it out with someone that was in long ongoing relationship, that THEN was made a Partner through role assignment, and necessitate training in Holacracy, and attendance at meetings... would pretty much set the stage for that person to become an employee.</p><p>I'm thinking as much about the IRS rules about definitions of contractors vs W-2 employees as I am thinking about whether an individual who is contractually providing project or service-under-direction (like data entry) ought to have Partner authorities or not.</p><p>I'm already leaning my opinion against, re: the authorities bit, and the more I think about training in Holacracy and meeting attendance, the more I lean against due to the definition of contractor part.</p><p>One last comment about Margaux's comment about volunteers - we are a very unique situation who as a nonprofit have a number of committed part-time and nearly full-time volunteers energizing roles in our anchor circle. &nbsp;That is unlikely to change - and the authorities they carry in Role as Partners is we think more aligned than with contractors.</p><p>Great stuff, very very helpful!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
