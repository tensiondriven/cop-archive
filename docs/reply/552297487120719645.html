  <dd><p>It seems that it should be constitutional. Wether it is or not I am not sure. I too would love to have async elections as an option. I would be perfectly okay if any member of that circle would like to simply escalate to a meeting for any reason.</p><p>As a member of a circle that is difficult to get together at the same time and place I want feature the constitution to clarify if we can hold elections asynchronously or not so that benefit we can hold elections simply and easily with getting all circle members as able to participate if they so choose regardless of if they are able to be at a specific time and place.</p></dd>
