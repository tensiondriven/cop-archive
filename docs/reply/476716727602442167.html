  <dd><p>Thanks for replying so quickly!</p><p>By no means am I eager to use a different term lol, and the irony doesn't escape me.&nbsp;As facilitator though, I'm not weighing in on whether what they say is accurate, but just that he provides a specific, logical example of how it inhibited one of their roles, which he might. To clarify:</p><ul><li>Is it conceivable that this proposal could be considered valid?</li><li>If so, could it result in valid governance output for any circle, or only the overall circle?</li><li>If so, the output can't be changing the term, right? It could only be creating an accountability for a role to decide on terms, right?</li><li>If not (to the first question), then how could a change like this be made? By constitutional amendment by the ratifiers?</li></ul><p>If it comes to it, I want to make sure I have a principled answer for him, and to make sure I don't subvert the process.</p></dd>
