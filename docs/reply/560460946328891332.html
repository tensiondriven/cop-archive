  <dd><p>Agree with Geoff. I'm curious about your intention with a checklist item "Review status of all projects you are assigned to".. As the response is limited to 'check' or 'no check' it may be simply that, to have a sense of the level of checkness. If actually you are using this as a way to get everyone to speak to all projects then I'd question its value and whether it should be a checklist item? Any projects can be assigned as projects and updated upon in 'Project' item on agenda. And a member <span class="fontstyle0">can explicitly requested updates on a specifc project</span> if they wish or simply raise a tension in Triarge</p></dd>
