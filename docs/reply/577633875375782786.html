  <dd><p>Great responses,&nbsp; always starting form a tension based approach to the problem&nbsp; I'd say that if the project has such a relevance/scope/duration that it might take advantage&nbsp;from encoding some preferred paths of&nbsp;communication/expectation then it might be worth creating a circle for it. If instead&nbsp;it has more requirements for continuous alignment&nbsp;over specialization then following other more "value-chain oriented" agile approaches (like Kanban) might help more than creating specific roles for it. If the two aspects cohexist than adopt both approaches at the same time (in the end isn't that what doing tacticals and governance is all about?). On projects that are repeatable by nature, encoding even some light communication patterns in roles together with some setup/Kpi management/support/post mortem expectations might help for quicker future re-editions .</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea.</p></dd>
