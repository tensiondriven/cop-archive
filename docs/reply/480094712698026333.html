<p>Ok,</p><p>maybe I am asking for too much of a creative effort here, and I don't even know if it would actually address our objectives, but in my dreams I'd love to see some sort of a &nbsp;simulated comparison between &nbsp;a standard way of conducting a meeting and the holacracy way starting from the same fictitious preconditions.</p><p>In such an example an hypothetical parallel meeting dealing with governance related issue could clearly underline the kinds of anti-patterns that Holacracy addressed&nbsp;by reducing the influence of personal opinion, biases and ego on the results of the meeting (also impacting speed)</p><p>One could also inject some nasty behavioral preconditions such as: mr A ates B because he was promoted last year, etc.</p><p>It's is a completely different kind of example (a meeting with a client) &nbsp;but when I watched this comedy sketch, which is obviously exagerated: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg</a></p><p>my memory went back to several antipatterns I had previously experienced... It's a good way to contextualize the starting point of something that needs to be fixed...</p>  </div>
