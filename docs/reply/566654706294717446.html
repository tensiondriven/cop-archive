<p>[@mention:456308404149183518]&nbsp;There are good reasons for people to discuss a possible governance change before proposing it, so I'm not saying it's not a good idea in your particular case. There are also risks involved, especially if the people are unexperienced&nbsp;Holacracy practitioners.</p><p>For example, if the situation at hand is particularly complex and impacts a lot of stakeholders, then it might make sense for the person collecting input from them before proposing a change in governance. This will allow him to start with a better proposal to address his tension.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, if the discussion is focused on trying to "convince" others or getting buy-in from the group to ensure that they don't object during the governance meeting, for example, then it's probably undermining your Holacracy practice.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a fine line between these two stances that experienced practitioners&nbsp;may be able to navigate, but if they are novices, my general advice would be to just bring it to the governance meeting — especially if you can have a good Holacracy coach who will help during the meeting.</p><p><strong>Regarding the happiness of the person filling the role</strong>, I don't know the specifics but sometimes it's just necessary to face the reality that what is best for the organization might not be our favorite course of action... I would probably offer some support to that person, acknowledging his&nbsp;feelings (it's not fun to feel like we "wasted" time on something),&nbsp;helping him understand that this change of direction is not a disapproval of his&nbsp;contribution as a worker, and that his talents really valuable&nbsp;working on something else.</p>  </div>
