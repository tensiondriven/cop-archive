  <dd><p>[@mention:562713145168686245]&nbsp;Hi, I just wanted to let you know that we have gained traction on this, and the uploading of the French Holacracy Habits is underway.&nbsp; If you email us around the end of the month (at the support email, which I can send you if you need it), we will probably be able to enable them for any organization who asks, as a "beta" feature, while we continue to work on the later habits.</p></dd>
