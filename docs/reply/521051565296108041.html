Isn't that conflicting ?</p></div></blockquote><p>Florent, excellent comment. I personally understand that this 2.4.3 only works in a perfect Holacracy system, or at least in a company where Holacracy is already mature. In which our company is not there yet.</p><p>So, we just vetoed this clause, and made clear that we would be doing all efforts to put the right souls in the right Roles, and that the souls have an open communication to say that they would like to be switched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
