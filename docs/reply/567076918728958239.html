<p>It sounds very weird to me to imagine that someone would expect me to do something in order to be happy (according to the one asking).</p><p>So in Holacracy having a "People happiness" circle proposing events, actions, support, etc. is fine. But as said Brian, I don't see how you could expect any role in the organisation to take action or project on that matter, as it probably does not serve any accountability or the purpose of the role being asked.</p><p>As I saw in some organisations (like HolacracyOne for instance), creating one circle (and sub-circles) dedicated to the operational work of the company, and another one for anything related to the partner (HR, Compensation, Happiness, etc.) might be a good lead&nbsp;? Maybe worth to try ? That's what we did in my company. But no Happiness circle :-)</p>  </div>
