  <dd><p>I have started exploring this book thanks to&nbsp;[@mention:450819477778576386]&nbsp;and have found a few processes promising for purpose exploration, retrospectives, learning processes, and strategy so far. I think it is really promising Andrea...I dont have the book with me, so all for now. Glad to hear you are looking at it. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
