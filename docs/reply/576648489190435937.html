  <dd><p>Hey SÃ©bastien - this could be a really good strategy, or a really bad one, or somewhere in between. The best way to find out? Try it, and see what tensions it creates! There's certainly nothing "wrong" with it from a Holacracy point of view. If it solves a tension to have a project circle, go ahead and propose one in your governance process. Good luck!</p></dd>
