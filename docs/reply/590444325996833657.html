  <dd><p>Exactly what Tom said, only piling on to say that your Lead Link might be under the impression that there is more authority to the role than what actually exists. That person does not need to 'agree' with everything the circle creates - and the objection 'this seems to duplicate something in this other role' would not test to be a valid objection unless that person was in that role.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd suggest the individual (or team) review the maturity map updates that include Role-specific maturity.</p></dd>
