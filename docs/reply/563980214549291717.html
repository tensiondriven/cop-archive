  <dd><p>The parent and staff handbooks hold more policies, as holacracy defines it, like our hours of operation and holidays were the things that came up in recent governance conversation. Since the way it currently is the handbooks are policies of the anchor circle they were changed through governance which I think is good. I think they do needed restricted edit rights, only through governance would probably be preferred. These documents are binding to everyone. I'm still trying to get my head around it. Thanks for helping me delve into the core of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
