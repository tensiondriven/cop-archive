  <dd><p>Thanks Vincent,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, it's possible to adopt Holacracy without including constitution in the company statutes.</p><p>Actually, we have checked SARL already, as other legal forms of company with an expert in Marseille, and the result is&nbsp;SAS remains the best in our case.</p><p>However, SAS requires the nomination of a President, who's power could allow to reject (un-adopt) constitution in my understanding.

And we would like to avoid slowing down our evolution for such issues.</p><p>In the end, I think we will trust Life, have Faith in the mindfulness of the team we are today and cross fingers for everything to get along well within a SAS for now.
