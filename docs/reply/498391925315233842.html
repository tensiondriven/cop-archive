  <dd><p>Thanks Vincent,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, it's possible to adopt Holacracy without including constitution in the company statutes.</p><p>Actually, we have checked SARL already, as other legal forms of company with an expert in Marseille, and the result is&nbsp;SAS remains the best in our case.</p><p>However, SAS requires the nomination of a President, who's power could allow to reject (un-adopt) constitution in my understanding. I may be wrong...hopefully ! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>The experts we have found so far do not know enough about holacracy (too new), therefore couldn't answer us with sufficient accuracy. Hence my question to the community here...</p><p>Meanwhile, we have taken a project to reach out encode.org and explore further solutions, but it may take some&nbsp;time I guess before we get valuable answers. And we would like to avoid slowing down our evolution for such issues.</p><p>In the end, I think we will trust Life, have Faith in the mindfulness of the team we are today and cross fingers for everything to get along well within a SAS for now. Our President could be elected through the holacratic way, as defined in the constitution for elected roles. I would trust this system&nbsp;to be fair enough ! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Anyhow, if I get to find out more about how to combine french laws and holacracy, I will definitely share it here for the benefit of all.</p><p>Thanks for your time and insights,</p><p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p></dd>
