  <dd><p>Thank you both for your answers<img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>[@mention:523162737680436711], one more technical question concerning "appoint additional persons to serve as a Core Circle Member". Does that mean for Elected Roles the following&nbsp;process:</p><p>- election process is started,<br />- name of a person from outside the circle is given,<br />- process is paused, because we can't continue without this person being present, so we try to bring this person in???<br />- let's assume this person is finally elected for a facilitator<br />- Lead Link "is asked" if he agrees based on&nbsp;2.3.4. to&nbsp;"appoint additional persons to serve as a Core Circle Member"</p><p>If there is another/better way&nbsp;than the above please describe it to me?</p></dd>
