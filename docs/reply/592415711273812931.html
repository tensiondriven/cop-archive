  <dd><p>@Shammi In case it helps clarify:&nbsp; It’s perfectly allowed to assign someone who is a circle’s Rep Link to its Lead Link role; it’s just not allowed to elect someone who is Lead Link into the Rep Link role.&nbsp; The prohibition isn’t on the same person filling both roles - there’s nothing wrong with that; the prohibition is on the assignment/election into the role, and only in one of those two cases.</p><p>The Lead Link's purpose is to hold and represent the interest of the parent circle INTO the sub-circle. The Rep Link's purpose is to hold the tensions OUT of the sub-circle into the parent circle. The reason a Lead Link can not be elected as its Rep Link is&nbsp;the two roles can conflict and one person can't reasonably process those tensions if they fill both roles. Basically, it creates a conflict of interest.</p></dd>
