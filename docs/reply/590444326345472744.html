  <dd><p>Thanks Chris - super useful. I'm guessing this may affect various members of the team at some point but right now it's me as founder and ex-CEO! When I heard everyone talking about 'powershift' issues in our Amsterdam training I naively hoped I would manage to avoid most of them. Hah!&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_rolleyes.gif" title="rolleyes" /></p><p>Although I'm seeing lots of positive green shoots across the team as a result of our adoption of Holacracy (which really make me smile!) I'm also hitting a trough with the personal challenges. Somehow it feels like my reaction to these challenges are making me manifest as a more traditional CEO than I was prior to Holacracy!</p></dd>
