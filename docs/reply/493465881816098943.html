  <dd><p>hi all, if I understand this discussion thread well then the meaning of the word&nbsp;Domain and Policy depend on the context, how it is applied in practice. It reads like there are at least 3 valid applications with each their different meaning/implication on how you use it pragmatically in real life. And hence understanding it is relatively complex.</p><p>What about differentiating the naming? If the concept is too broad then lets come up with easy to understand different names for each of the applications. Eg create a simple definition for the "Global-domain" (which is delegated out of the anchor circle) and the "Local-domain" (only valid within one circle). Sorry for the non creative new names...&nbsp;<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">Just to give an illustration that with differentiated names for simple&nbsp;applications would make the</span> <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">constitution easier&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.6; letter-spacing: 0px;">support practice. Not even sure if this example is valid/pragmatic, but just to share a thought on how different naming could&nbsp;reduce complexity.</span></p><p>Hope I made a clear point. Looking forward to read more responses on how to pragmatically apply Domains/Policies.&nbsp;</p><p>Koen (Veltman)</p></dd>
