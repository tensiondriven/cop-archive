  <dd><p>Yo, Serge.</p><p>I am a bit confused by what you are trying to say as the difference between this being governance or tactical, to be honest. You could argue that "doing the work" is often a tactical thing, but no Tension is explicitly one or the other. If the work is always being done in a certain way or has no need to be done at all, should you not update your governance to accurately reflect that?</p><p>It has nothing to do with WHO our LL was. Based on our experience when we did have a LL, we realized that there was practically no reason for that work to exist in the way it did. The Role itself was basically obsolete and we determined a much better way for our Circle to energize the functions that were previously done by the LL.</p><p>Hopefully that clears it up a bit, but if not, please do let me know. I am eager to get as much feedback on this as possible and poke any holes in our system.</p></dd>
