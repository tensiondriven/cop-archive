  <dd><p>Hey&nbsp;[@mention:454478741268114544]&nbsp;For me (and it may seems weird) an interpretation is never wrong, this is just what it is. In a case I sense I would have a different interpretation than the one from the Anchor Circle Sec. , I would ask myself what's the best way to process my tension if I does care. May be explaining the rules of the constitution is a pathway if I sense that such sec. don't get the constitution right (and may be I'm fully wrong) or go to governance to make such records clearer in order to remove the tension or also ask for a reelection if I sense the person is not a good fit for the role, and ay be there are other ways I cannot imagine here as I'm currently in the actual situation.</p></dd>
