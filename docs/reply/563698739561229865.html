  <dd><p>&gt;&nbsp;Policies related to hours of operation....aren't a great fit for the organization's governance because the organization doesn't own/control the people, it only owns/controls the roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Just to acknowledge that I know the theory&nbsp;here is that these things don't fit in governance etc - but actually what we find in our practice is: Governance is a pretty good tool for this kind of stuff. Makes it visible to everyone. Makes it editable through a robust process. We (or at least, in our organisation, *I*) know that this is wrong in theory - but pragmatically, in practice, it is useful, helpful and safe to try.</p></dd>
