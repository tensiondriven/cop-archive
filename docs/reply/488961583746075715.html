An accountability only&nbsp;tells you&nbsp;what you can expect from the&nbsp;role that has the accountability, but has no impact on other roles.&nbsp;</p><p>The authority to act comes from&nbsp;§1.3, unless limited by a Domain:</p><h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">1.3 Authority to Act</h3><p style="margin-left: 30px;">As a Partner assigned to a Role, you have the authority to execute any Next-Actions you reasonably believe are useful for enacting your Role’s Purpose or Accountabilities.</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;">However, you cannot exert control or cause a material impact within a Domain owned by another Role or another sovereign entity, unless you have their permission. The authority granted in this paragraph is further limited by <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art213">Section 2.1.3</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
