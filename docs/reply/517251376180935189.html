  <dd><p>I don't know if the actual cards are different, but the Tactical Meeting Cards under the Printed Tools link (still) say "Project" Updates Round while the Constitution says "Progress" Updates. I wouldn't have realized it if it weren't recently pointed out in the Practicing Holacracy forum.</p><p>This was actually a point of contention among one of the circles I facilitate because we were following the meeting cards and someone was recapping one of their accountabilities and I stopped them (citing the "project" aspect of the Project Updates round).</p><p>After rereading 4.2.3 (d) I have a better understanding of the round, but please make sure to update the cards. I think they could be cause for undue tension!</p></dd>
