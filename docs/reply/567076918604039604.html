  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:548355922639373031]&nbsp;! I am from Paraguay, so the translation is in a neutral Latinamerican Spanish. I do not know how much will it vary from Spanish (from spain), It is a matter of reading It, and seeing if &nbsp;it would be neccesary to have different ones. I have not been following up on this, but last time I check (maybe 6 months ago) Not many changes have been made since I&nbsp;translated it. I know it needs a little bit more work.</p></dd>
