  <dd><p>An interesting question Sally, and one&nbsp;I have seen threads on here about before.&nbsp;</p><p>Having tried and seen many different approaches to this, my approach is to seek to make any definition of&nbsp;Holacracy relevant to the context&nbsp;I am in. There are many different ways to define and describe&nbsp;Holacracy (replacing hierarchy, evolution, distributing authority, purposeful organisation, processing tensions to effect change...) , and different definitions will be more relevant to different people in different contexts. So&nbsp;I try to get a sense of where someone is and what their interests may be&nbsp;before offering a definition that&nbsp;I sense might fit best for them.&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I think your&nbsp;approach of collecting ideas of how to define it is a good one and&nbsp;Iâ€™d love to see a collectively sourced 'Repository of Definitions of Holacracy'.&nbsp;</p></dd>
