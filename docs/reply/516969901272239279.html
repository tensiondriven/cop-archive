  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Andrea Demaria posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My understanding of the term triage in Holacracy is that no solutions are created in the tactical meeting but only decisions are made on what are the next steps (next action, project, wait for trigger, think about a tension)&nbsp;to be followed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>Hello Andrea, you are correct. Since the Role has the authority to find a solution and make the call, it´s not part of the tactical meeting to&nbsp;<em>talk until we find the solution.</em></p><p>It doesn´t mean you can´t call for a meeting to discuss a subject. However, this won´t be a tactical meeting, and the best the peers can do is help you finding a solution, but you will be the one to make the call and take the responsibility.</p></dd>
