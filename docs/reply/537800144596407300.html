  <dd><p>Hi Xuan. I agree it won't conflict so is a good proposal.</p><p>If it helps, we are a small company and have the following roles for recruitment:</p><ol><li>Someone who decides <strong>what</strong> the future staffing /types of roles /levels /salary banding needs are (the CEO who has an overview of all Circles and the Company budget)</li><li>Someone who decides on <strong>how</strong> to attract and recruit people to the organisation (an HR professional) - which is the role you originally asked about</li><li>Someone who makes the actual hiring decision of <strong>who</strong> will be hired so long as it is in-line with the spec set out in role 1 above (the Circle LL).</li></ol><p>Good luck</p><p>Julia</p></dd>
