  <dd><p>Hello, R08!</p><p>This can be very easily done by creating a Policy in your Circle's Governance. Something to the gist of the below might get you what you need:</p><p>"In the Circle's Tactical Meetings, an additional step is added after between the Check In Round and Checklist Review, which is called "Mission Statement Reflection". During this step, the Secretary reads the Circle's Purpose. The Facilitator then allows each participant in turn to share any thoughts relevant to the Purpose of the Circle."</p><p>I have no idea if this is exactly what you guys do, so you will probably need to change it up. All you have to do in the Policy is say what is added and how it works.</p><p>Hopefully that helps!</p></dd>
