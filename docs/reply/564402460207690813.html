  <dd><p>Capturing a tension and associated desire in that format forces getting some more clarity, which can be useful. That said,&nbsp;I usually wouldn't&nbsp;recommend it&nbsp;for new practitioners - it's more than is needed and I'd worry it would&nbsp;contribute to triggering Holacracy overwhelm. &nbsp;But I think it's a great&nbsp;tool for some people at certain&nbsp;points in their Holacracy journey, or when you want to convey the tension more effectively to others...</p></dd>
