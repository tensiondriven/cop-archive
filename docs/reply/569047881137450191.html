  <dd><p>Hello!&nbsp;We have not shared this not even internally yet. I had mistakenly assumed that it was on Creative Commons and that you could have been interested into a free translation to&nbsp;integrate/compare with no obligation at all. No problem about not using it. Forget about it,&nbsp;looking forward to having soon the "official" translation.</p></dd>
