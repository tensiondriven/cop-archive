  <dd><p>Hey Tiziano,</p><p>(preamble: we tried various, but typically you come up with too many or some without real relevance to people and thus&nbsp;without the intended effect - so my advice is to chose only a few and prototype the impact...)</p><p><strong>Checklist</strong> items IMO should best&nbsp;refer to establishing useful habits, such as:</p><p>* Noticed a tension and captured it<br />* Addressed&nbsp;roles in mails (in addition/instead of people)<br />* Weekly review of Trusted System (GTD) done<br />* ...</p><p><strong>Metrics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>* Number of Tac Meetings / month (are there regular meetings?)<br />* # of Agenda items (indicator if tensions make it into meetings)<br />* Trend: # of items processed (does the circle get faster?) (deduce it from the latter and the Secretary gets a&nbsp;good indication if the circle&nbsp;needs more regular meetings)<br />* &nbsp;for certain roles such as Holacracy Support roles&nbsp;(helping circle members to turn their tensions into proposals or at least show them pathways to process) it is also helpful to see if their support is used a lot or not at all (# of support requests)<br />* ...</p><p>Maybe that triggers&nbsp;some thoughts for you...</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
