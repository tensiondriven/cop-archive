  <dd><p>&gt;what do you think, is it a valid objection during governance meeting, that there no one to fill the newly&nbsp;defined role.</p><p>Unless the objector can clearly state why <em>creating the role will&nbsp;cause harm</em>, it is not a valid objection.&nbsp;</p><p>And as creating a Role does not bind any resources, it will probably be hard to argue this point - but that's not for outside people to judge.</p><p>In any case, in practise, you can always move to integration: the tension that lead to proposing&nbsp;the new role to be created still needs to be addressed. The objecting partner has to come up with an alternative suggestion.</p></dd>
