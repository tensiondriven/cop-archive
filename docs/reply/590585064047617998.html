  <dd><p>I appreciate all the comments above, but I would ask this: What tension are you trying to resolve? It seems to me that you would only need the answer to this question if: A. someone other than the lead link is setting priorities and no one knows if they are required to follow them<br />or B. the lead link is failing to set priorities that someone else thinks are necessary.<br />In both cases, I would think that this should be easily resolvable by bringing the tension to the circle.&nbsp;<br />What am I missing here?</p></dd>
