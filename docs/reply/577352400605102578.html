<p>Ian:&nbsp; I appreciate that cultural reminder and language nuance; that tweak makes a lot of sense to me.</p><p>Eliana:&nbsp; One of the downsides of adopting Holacracy is definitely that it requires good coaches - not just good referees - at least until the team has stabilized around playing the new game.&nbsp; And it sounds like you've got referees&nbsp;when you still need coaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple refereeing is all you need (and maybe all you want) once the team all know how to play the game, but&nbsp;refereeing alone is not that helpful (and&nbsp;potentially quite frustrating) when people don't know how to play the game effectively yet.&nbsp; Maybe consider bringing a skilled coach back in for those teams?&nbsp; Or, if budget won't allow that,&nbsp;perhaps consider trying to train-up some of those referees into full-fledged coaches, with the help of a Holacracy Coach Training?&nbsp; I sure do empathize with the challenge you (and the whole team) face...</p>  </div>
