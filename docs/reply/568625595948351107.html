  <dd><p>Hi Adam,&nbsp;</p><p>your reflections make a lot of sense.&nbsp;The difference&nbsp;you make in terms of&nbsp;rules of engagement in the two contractual positions (employees vs. contractors)&nbsp;resonate with us as well.</p><p>We may say that information to&nbsp;make transparent are all the information that can make people's fulfillment of a role easier and smoother, not necessarily&nbsp;ALL the existing information.&nbsp;</p><p>But I still don't feel at ease in being the one deciding what is the information a group or different groups may need instead of leaving them to discriminate what is useful from what is not useful. It still sounds like the old "I am the boss and I know what you need. I'm giving you access to this and I'll not give you access to that" kind of low-trust relationship.</p><p>Do you see what I mean?</p><p>Giovanna</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
