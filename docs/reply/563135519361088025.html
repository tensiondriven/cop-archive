  <dd><p>Jenn sounds like you're coming up against the specific meaning of Policy in Holacracy, vs the way it's used in most organisations.</p><p>Yes, from what you say I think you want it to be the case that the&nbsp;Curriculum Guide document cannot be edited without permission from the Curriculum Co-ordinator - so you are using a domain here to set up this restriction on edit rights for this important document. &nbsp;I think (from the info I have) that you are right, it doesn't&nbsp;sound like a Policy - sounds more like something to publish as a note.</p><p>When it comes to the Parent Handbook and Staff Handbook, is the same thing true? Are you hoping to restrict edit rights? Or are the things in these documents that you want to be binding all the time on everyone?</p></dd>
