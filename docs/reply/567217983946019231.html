  <dd><p><strong><em>New to Holacracy.&nbsp;</em></strong>Welcome! You came to the right place to ask questions, so you're off to a great start. : )&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Have completed defining roles in our organization (65), inputting all into</strong> <strong>GlassFrog.&nbsp;</strong></em>That seems like a high number for only 5 people to just be starting. Could be fine. But one thing to watch out for here (and use your own best judgment), is that there is sometimes too much psychological investment in the initial structure, which makes it less likely you'll change it. So, our general recommendation is to craft the initial structure to cover the basics, and then let the governance process start doing its thing (which is filling in any gaps). Again, could be fine in your case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Having trouble now deciding who to assign to core roles,&nbsp;</em></strong>The good news here is that you only need to assign Lead Links. The other 3 core roles (Secretary, Facilitator, and Rep Link) are all elected. Meaning, just let anyone start as Secretary and Facilitator (usually the person with the most experience), and their first job will be to schedule a governance meeting and hold elections (respectively)!&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>and thinking that perhaps our organization is too small to run Holacracy? Only 5 employees,&nbsp;</em></strong>I'd say 2 people is the minimum number of people needed, so you have plenty at 5.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>...so most everyone is a member in most</em></strong><em><strong>every circle.</strong>&nbsp;</em>Yep, that is not a problem. In fact, it's a good indication that the circle/role structure may be particularly helpful for allowing everyone to make fast, authoritative decisions without needing everyone to&nbsp;be involved.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Can the facilitator have other roles (and hence tensions) in a circle he's facilitating?
