  <dd><p>[@mention:491495232183315418]: yeah that's a good point. If by "optional" they mean, "Hey, consider doing this because I think it could help your purpose, but I don't really expect you to do it," then it <em>might</em>&nbsp;be an invalid proposal (though these are very rare).&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, since the proposer thinks the accountability "may be needed," it's probably based on a tension of at least, "Hey, someone should be paying attention to this," which is really all an accountability is; an allocation of conscious attention.&nbsp;</p></dd>
