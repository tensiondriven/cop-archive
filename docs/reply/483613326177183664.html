  <dd><p>We made our own evaluation procedure. We have a peer evaluation every 3 months. In small groups (can be a circle) &nbsp;we give each other feedback (what went good,&nbsp;can be improved). The individual makes his / her own self-reflection and compares it in the group with the feedback&nbsp;from the&nbsp;other circle members. And tells the group what he&nbsp;/ she will do with it and how it fits with the self-relfection. The individual can make projects and write in Glassfrog or capture it in an other way</p></dd>
