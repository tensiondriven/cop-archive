  <dd><p>I agree with both Jean-Michel and Margaux.&nbsp; Best to attack this through governance, and the possiblities are endless.&nbsp; You could even have a "Backup" role accountable for "Performing the accountabilities of roles x, y, and z on a short-term basis in the event of holiday or sick leave of the primary role-filler for that role."</p><p>As to your question of the role-filler putting that work back on the other role who raised the tension, it sounds like a valid proposal (and one that would not be easy to object to!).</p></dd>
