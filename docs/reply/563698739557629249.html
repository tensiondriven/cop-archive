  <dd><p>[@mention:476716727616148334]&nbsp;I love that one - this happens a lot in my experience with early adopters. And this is a tricky one. My interpretation (in your example) is that this is probably not a valid objection and one way I would react as a Facilitator is probably to time out and give some coaching to have the opportunity to explain that there is not such constraint of having purpose and accountabilities aligned. There could some case where it makes a lot of sense to add an accountability to a role even if such acc. is not aligned to the role's purpose, rather than creating a new role for instance, may be because this could be the best role to enact such ongoing activity. And I would give them a concrete example I would find from iGi's holarchy (I know there are some).</p></dd>
