  <dd><p>We don't actually use the statuses of project updates. We do updates on any of the projects that have made progress since the last meeting. We have no policies around project reports. Many of our "projects" in glassfrog and in our meetings are really accountabilities; we do it this way because glassfrog doesn't have a explicit functionality for reporting on accountabilities and most of our work is really accountability based and not on temporary projects. We go through the "projects" on a per person basis.&nbsp;</p></dd>
