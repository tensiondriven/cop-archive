  <dd><p>Then what does it mean for a Lead Link to "control any Domain defined on the Circle" assuming it's un-delegated?</p><blockquote><p>A Circleâ€™s Lead Link inherits the Purpose and any Accountabilities on the Circle itself, and <strong>controls any Domains defined on the Circle, just as if the Circle were only a Role and the Lead Link filled that Role.</strong></p></blockquote></dd>
