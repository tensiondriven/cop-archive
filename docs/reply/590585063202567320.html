  <dd><p>Nice questions Fritz,</p><p>I will take them back to the team to discuss;</p><p>"Did anyone define what level of adoption should be targeted (maybe from the ratifiers)? Is there any budget allocated for improvements?"</p><p>We wanted full adoption but we never defined what that would look like (sigh).&nbsp; We don't have a clarified budget per se but we have been able to pay people and make&nbsp;time/space to work on aspects of implementation.&nbsp; For example, I could likely&nbsp;make the case for a budget for coaching if we felt that was necessary... but that would require a gap we wanted to close that we felt could be filled by coaches.&nbsp; Without a roadmap to success or evaluation,&nbsp;I cannot make that case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"Should people (employees?) care about that level? Did they sign something were they declare to pursuit holacracy and its goals? Are there incentives to invest time into a good holacracy practice?"</p><p>Great questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea came from the team when we engaged them around org development.&nbsp; They have&nbsp;not signed anything but we have had pretty good buy in.&nbsp; I think the incentives are clarity in roles and in expectations (but that might just be me). I think everyone has seen some reward from implementation but I haven't explicitly asked.&nbsp; I will do so this afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
