Is that right? That's not how it works: Holacracy deals only with the <em>work</em>. What do you need?&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" class="noBorder" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does this help? I am not really clear on what your situation is. It might help if you clarified from what perspective you are asking: are you a fellow circle member? Are you the one responsible for delivering to the client? What are you trying to achieve?</p></div><p>Hi Martin,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I 'm not waiting for someone to set priorities. But you made the confusion in my head&nbsp;more clear for me. :-) I suggest the situation in which a lead link in circle A sets priorities and a lead link in circle B sets priorities. A person, f.e. John, is fulfilling a role in circle A and a role in circle B. John is asked by both lead links to prioritise the work so it meets the priorities of the circle (A and B). John senses a tension because he can't fulfill both roles like he wants to. What should he do? Ask both or one lead link to allocate more resources to the role, ask both lead links or one to reallocate the role(s) to someone else?</p></dd>
