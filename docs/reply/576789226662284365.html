Still puzzled.</p></div></blockquote><p>In such case, the invited person may leave the meeting whenever she wants, she also may ask the Facilitator to process such tension in priority so that she would not waste her time, etc..</p><p>I would recommend here just&nbsp;to follow the tension if any. In some cases, those invited persons may be happy to stay during the whole meeting and contribute by asking questions, reacting... who knows. The invited person is a sovereign entity - may choose how to best use their time - IMO no need here to save them by ruling what they should do.&nbsp;</p></dd>
