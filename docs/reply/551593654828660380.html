  <dd><p>[@mention:449411339497350002]. In your example the restrictions come from other Policies that are not directly related (Branding) to the Domain Website Strategy. Looking at the last paragraph of your post it is valid Governance to set a Circle Policy that impacts the Domain.</p><p>For example a Circle Policy: "All relevant roles may add new people biography to the assigned team pages&nbsp;on the website" would be OK.</p><p>This Policy would then trump a Policy from the Domain holder on this and the Domain holder should bring his Policies in line with this Circle Policy.</p><p>Is this the correct interpretation of your post?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
