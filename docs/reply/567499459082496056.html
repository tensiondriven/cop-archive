  <dd><p>Andrew,</p><p>I think that meetings being time boxed is a matter of best practice that isn't clearly specified in the constitution.&nbsp; However, it is fairly easy to back-fill a justification for interpreting the constitution to require time boxed meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For tactical meetings, paragraph 4.2.3.e says, "The Facilitator must attempt to allow time for processing every agenda item within the meeting, and&nbsp;[...] may cut off the processing of any item that’s taking more than its due share of the remaining meeting time." I think clearly implies that the meeting has a fixed end time.</p><p>For governance meetings, section 3.3.2 says, "A Circle may only conduct its Governance Process in a meeting if the Secretary has given all Core Circle Members reasonable advance notice that a Governance Meeting will be held, including its time and location." I think that extending a governance meeting past the end time that was included in the notice would run afoul of this section, therefore the meeting must be time boxed.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making meetings time boxed aren't the only interpretations that pass the "reasonable judgement" requirement of section 3.4.&nbsp; For example, a reasonable person could conclude that scheduling a meeting from "9 AM - 5 PM (or until there are no more tensions to process)" meets the requirements of the constitution.&nbsp; Personally, I think that's a poor way to run an organization but it's still allowed.</p></dd>
