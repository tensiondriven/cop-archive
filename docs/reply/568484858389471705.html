<p>Hi Fajar! I have been thinking about this topic recently, as the tactical structure doesn‘t leave any spaces for Mindstorming, Experience Transfer or Retrospective corrections but we really need to adjust our processes and also the way we are working together since the implementation. I don’t think that a Governance is the right place to do a retrospective, anyway I was thinking about a Retrospective Workshop to be followed by a &nbsp;Governance, so that we can discuss and use the collective intelligence in a creative way first and then just implement the needed adjustments in a holocratic way while Governance Meeting. I think both kind of methods are complementary, as we still need to push collaboration within our team and we need the commitment of every single one of us to build up the new strategy. Once we find a common vision, we will be able to go back stronger into the holocratic governance process, I guess.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
