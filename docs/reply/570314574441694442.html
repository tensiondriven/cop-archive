  <dd><p>Great one!&nbsp;</p><p>Testing this one is tricky because none of the test questions are really designed to get at the confusion (and there are two possible confusions).&nbsp;</p><p>One possible confusion is that they don't understand that accountabilities are 1) up to the role-fillers interpretation; 2) prioritized relative to other work.
