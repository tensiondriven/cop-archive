  <dd><p>Hi Xavier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you. I've been thinking about co-working spaces but if we all do that, then the question of money comes: who should pay? The company? That's a lot of money at the end of the year and it doesn't create value for the company as interactions are outside of the company. The person? Then it becomes an issue if she doesn't have a huge&nbsp;compensation. I really think co-working works but between partners of the same company. That's the conclusion I've had and I am trying to see if it is the only solution...</p></dd>
