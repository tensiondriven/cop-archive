  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>typically I would suggest not to include targets. as targets are a relatively static way of thinking of evolution. you sort of force your view on the future and targets take attention away from what is actually happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>a "middle way" answer could be to introduce a metric that is "difference with ambition". eg if you have a certain market share target of say 10% you could introduce the metric "current market share difference to 10% ambition". So how much market share increase does a role need to achieve to reach this ambition. In this way you keep a metric as just showing information, and makes it more relevant to your specific context without introducing "fixed targets"</p></dd>
