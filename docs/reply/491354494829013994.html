  <dd><blockquote><p>It seems crazy that on day one in an organization that the new partner would be nominating in elections.</p></blockquote><p>Is that an intellectually-sensed concern (sounds like it may be), or have you actually experienced something getting in the way of the work as a result of having new partners in elections? &nbsp;If the former, then anything you might propose wouldn't be a valid proposal in the first place, because your proposal won't meet the threshold and test in Constitution <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art322" target="_blank">ยง3.2.2</a> and <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art323" target="_blank">ยง3.2.3</a>.</p><p>This is a key distinction Holacracy aims for and helps you practice: differentiating between&nbsp;intellectually-sensed theoretical&nbsp;concerns, and experientially-sensed tensions. &nbsp;One of Holacracy's goals is to have an&nbsp;organization's design driven by the latter and protected from the former...</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
