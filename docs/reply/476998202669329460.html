  <dd><p>Hi Andrew! Very interesting question as we are facing the exact same problem...</p><p>What did you decide in the end? How did it evolve since then?</p><p>Doing a circle for each team seems&nbsp;okish, but then do&nbsp;they all create Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev.. roles internally? Starts to sound weird. Someone here suggested to create PO, SM, Dev.. roles at GCC level and then Cross-Link them to the different teams (which also sounds weird with so many Cross-Links).</p><p>Any feedback appreciated!</p></dd>
