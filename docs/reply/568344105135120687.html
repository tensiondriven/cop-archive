  <dd><p>Our experience at GT is slightly different, since we don't have contractors in the way that you do - but our preference is: share everything that&nbsp;can be shared.&nbsp;</p><p>That would be kind of an answer to your question ""how much and what kind of information shall be shared?" - and it would also be kind of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> an answer, since it just reframes the problem as "what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> be shared?".</p><p>But maybe that's a helpful reframe?&nbsp;</p><p>I also call to mind Theory X/Theory Y - can we trust people with this information? Well if we assume that we can trust them, they are more likely to behave in a trustworthy way; if we assume that they can't be trusted, they are more likely to try and 'game the system'</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
