  <dd><p>Hi Gerald, Italy here.</p><p>I confirm that it will be a concern for us as well, as we have several forms of representation of &nbsp;workers unions inside companies, and our labour laws are pretty complex</p><p>To my knowledge those who have applied Holacracy in Italy so far have not yet impacted any of the bylaws of the national contracts, I have heard that&nbsp;the unions are interested in the topic (at least at the local level, Holacracy being still unknown to the masses), we have work to do in this direction.&nbsp;</p><p>There's room for work in the realm of what we &nbsp;call "the second level of negotiation" (which sees the local union representatives and the company as the main actors in customizing the national contract to specific needs)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andrea</p></dd>
