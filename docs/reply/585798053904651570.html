  <dd><p>Hi Tom, this helps a lot. I was sensing the same as u said that we had been doing a problematic thing by asking peolle to shop for roles. There is some block in me which makes me think that choice is more important and i realise thst takes away the idea of finding the right fit, which is also a job to do or an accountability. It has taken some weight off me and its easy to take authority on this or have the lead link take that authority. I guess the shopping for roles was a kind of consensus behaviour, which is not the best to do and especially in Holacracy.</p></dd>
