  <dd><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question that jumps out for me is: who is <em>you</em>? You ask if someone knows "how you set priorities". Who is that? What are you trying to do?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, nobody in Holacracy sets priorities for others; except, when useful or necessary, the Lead Link of a Circle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If your role is in trouble because of someone else not doing their job, you can</p><ul><li>ask the Lead Link to set a priority</li><li>ask the Lead Link to reallocate the role to someone else</li><li>ask the Lead Link to allocate more resources to the role</li><li>do the work yourself</li><li>...</li></ul><p>You seem to be focusing on a <em>person</em>, wanting someone to "set priorities" for them. Is that right? That's not how it works: Holacracy deals only with the <em>work</em>. What do you need?&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" class="noBorder" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Does this help? I am not really clear on what your situation is. It might help if you clarified from what perspective you are asking: are you a fellow circle member? Are you the one responsible for delivering to the client? What are you trying to achieve?</p></dd>
