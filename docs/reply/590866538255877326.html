  <dd><p>Hi Daniela, we at E-quality Italia are adopting Holacracy since December 2016. It is (slowly) moving forward, main issues are the lack of a professional coach (I was trained by Holacracy One, but I had no previous coaching experience) and the cumbersome italian law system. Feel free to get in touch!</p></dd>
