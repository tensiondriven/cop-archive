  <dd><p>Xavier, I have heard of some situations like this. One thought is that the constitution only says that Lead Link may exclude the members as a core circle member, not that they have to. I would suggest proposing a policy changing which ones are core circle members by default since in my view the constitution only gives some starting points on this matter if you have a case where you want to encode something different than what happens by default in 2.2.2 and 2.2.3.</p><p>I would be happy to give feedback here if you want to run a policy by me on this. I think it is a sign of positive engagement that you have these issues.&nbsp;</p></dd>
