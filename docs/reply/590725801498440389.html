  <dd><p>Dear Karilen,<br /><br />We are using a badge based system similar to the one H1 using and I see that one of the hardest part in it for us is what you mentioned about making the salary raise system dependable on the profitability of the organisation. This is what we struggle to solve, how to build in a break/limitation in the salary raises connected to the badging because it is now an organically flowing system and we have no control over the mass salary increase.</p><p>If anyone has the same problem or have a great idea to solve, please let me know <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> Thank you!</p></dd>
