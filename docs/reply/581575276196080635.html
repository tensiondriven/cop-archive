  <dd><p>[@mention:476716727616148334]&nbsp;That's the one, thanks! I edited my original post.&nbsp;</p><p>An example to the situation I describe is, say: John proposes to create a policy about mentorship to clarify what's expected of the Mentor role. But Sonia objects because "we already have rules about that, and this policy conflicts with those rules, so it would cause confusion." whereas the rules in question are part of the legacy policies of the organization, and are not in governance.</p><p>My point is that instead of objecting, it's best to let it happen and then notify the relevant roles/circle that if they want their "legacy policies" around mentorship to be standard across the company, they should adopt them in governance.&nbsp;</p></dd>
