  <dd><p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;for the suggestions. One key element of the cheat sheet is that I tried to keep it as simple and concise as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I chose words that are the most concrete and down-to-earth as possible for people to immediately relate to them - and they can consult the constitution if they want the exact wording. I'm afraid mentioning the "ideal" would make it less immediately&nbsp;actionable for people. Thoughts?&nbsp;</p></dd>
