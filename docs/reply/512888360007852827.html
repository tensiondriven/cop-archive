  <dd><p>Hey Keith - I'd go with option #1, or maybe a slight variation like "No role&nbsp;may assign a partner&nbsp;into roles within&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Lead Operating Circle&nbsp;</em>until that partner has agreed to...". &nbsp;And you're right, that leaves open the question about what happens if current Core Circle Members don't want to agree. &nbsp;But that's reality: if it happens, you'll need to decide what to do about that (e.g. remove them from roles?), and hiding&nbsp;that reality in an NVGO policy statement isn't actually going to make it more likely that people will follow through on the desired agreements... &nbsp;So I'd go with a policy for new members, and then consciously ask the current members to agree to it, knowing that they could say "no", and that would then lead to a question about what to do with that no.&nbsp; These are behavior changes you want, as you point out,&nbsp;and that's got to start with people consciously agreeing to them or&nbsp;the uphill battle is a lot steeper...</p></dd>
