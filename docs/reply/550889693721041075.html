  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353],</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal was dropped by the Proposer. It was very difficult for Objector to come up with a counter proposal because the Tension was to reduce the number of invoices you need to bring after you spent company money. And this is imposed by the law .</p><p>The process was followed. The question was if we can extend the "Governance" from the Secretary accountabilities to any other governance the company has to follow but is not internally generated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Andrei</p></dd>
