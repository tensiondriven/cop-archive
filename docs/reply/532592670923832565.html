  <dd><p>Tyler: to me, that is a bug. When one purposefully sets a role up with&nbsp;just a name, that is not "incomplete": that is as complete as it gets at that moment. I'd rather have Glassfrog honor that, than "coach" the organisation by&nbsp;coloring&nbsp;perfectly valid roles signal-red as if there was an error.</p><p>I get that it can be helpful that Glassfrog "coaches": this particular behavior though has created more confusion that good in our organisation. (People really study the constitution, and then Glassfrog tells them they did something "incomplete", when they clearly did not!)</p><p>A better way to coach this point would be to suggest a change&nbsp;<em>at role creation</em>, not after the fact, and to make it a <em>suggestion</em>, not a judgement.</p></dd>
