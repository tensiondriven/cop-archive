  <dd><p>Hey Alexey,</p><p>My take on this is that I would not try to sell Holacracy to anybody - won't work or it would take so much energy on your side. Question for you : is the power holder(s) interested enough by Holacracy so that you can sell an interactive 2 hours conference or a 2 Days Discovery Session. If you cant' sell anything, don't waste your time, they are not ready and teachable enough to transform themselves. We don't need every org. adopting Holacracy. There are enough pionneers end early adopters as far as I can see the market, which is growing quite fast by the way. Leave the status quo, find early adopters.</p><p>Hope this helps</p><p>Bernard Marie</p></dd>
