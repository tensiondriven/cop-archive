  <dd><p>I agree with Karilen that the harm in this instance is very limited.&nbsp; If the integration round is conducted properly, the proposer's tension will have been met and the objector's objection will have been satisfied.&nbsp; If there is ancillary benefit due to an overreach, I think that's fine.</p><p><br />If you're stuck in integration because the objector keeps dragging in other preexisting issues, I think that may be a sign that the facilitator should have tested the objection more thoroughly.&nbsp; Good objection testing will get quite specific about what part of the proposal is objectionable, and during integration the facilitator can drive the conversation back to that element.</p><p>I have seen a number of difficult integrations where I felt like the root cause was an insufficiently tested objection, which left the circle unclear about what to integrate, or with too large an integration task.&nbsp; This is something all facilitators will get a better feel for over time.</p></dd>
