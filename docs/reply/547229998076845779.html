  <dd><p>[@mention:456449141667144364]&nbsp;sorry for not updating earlier, missed your question.</p><p>We decided to keep it simple for now, we removed the conflicting role in the sub circle. Basically we now say&nbsp;it's safe enough to try to drop all tensions in the 'correct' circle and that now works for us. So we actually solved it without any big measures.</p><p>My conclusion from this are:</p><ul><li>You cannot expect to be the only one to have an accountability on something without making a domain</li><li>There are no official measures that prevent sub circles from creating roles that are outside the scope of the purpose or accountabilities of the circle as a whole</li><li>Domains are a strict way to solve this, but just talking actually solved it for us, we just needed to reassure that tensions <em>will</em> be resolved correctly and quickly.</li></ul></dd>
