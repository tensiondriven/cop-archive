  <dd><p>Hi Keith, I work in Finance environments for 20 years now, believe me I do understand what strict processes means. I don't think nonprofit organizations are more strict than the others, not all of them at least. I'm convince you could find a way, through appropriate governance, to stick to the requirements. I join Brian's advice as you should maybe have a few workshops with a coach to help you out with this "translation".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
