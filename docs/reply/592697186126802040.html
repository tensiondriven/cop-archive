  <dd><p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:493184366878843164]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:549200391411054975]&nbsp;for ur responses. Jenn, I hear u that a good role fit is important and coupled with training and feedback it works well. Does that mean we need to pick up the right people who fit the role or are interested in it. Diet it mean, No point picking up people who are not interested in certain things and pushing them to do that stuff. Am i understanding u correctly. I am hearing some resonance in this.&nbsp;</p><p>I have some pain around people who r educated(degree), or upper caste, or class are not interested in manual work, which leads to or perpetuates some kind of structural violence. Am still trying to figure it out.&nbsp;</p></dd>
