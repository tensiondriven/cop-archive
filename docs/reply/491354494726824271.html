  <dd><p>Hey Fred,</p><p>glad it helped.</p><p>I could envision&nbsp;the following situation: since I am also a Circle Member filling other roles apart from acting&nbsp;as Facilitator I might have the feeling that the proposal is not grounded in reality and I don't understand the underlying tension. Then I could imagine to act as if another role of the circle has asked me&nbsp;as Facilitator to check the tension behind the proposal. Has never happened to me though...</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
