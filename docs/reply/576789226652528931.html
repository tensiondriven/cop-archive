  <dd><p>My&nbsp;interpretation is that&nbsp;she&nbsp;would not be able to process other tensions because she&nbsp;would not be able to raise valid objections. In that case, she would be a Core Circle Member for the duration of the Governance Meeting (check-in, administrative concerns, building agenda, closing) but only for the specific tension. Is my interpretation correct? Thanks.</p></dd>
