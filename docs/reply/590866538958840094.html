  <dd><p>One of my clients&nbsp;has their shareholding and board outside of Holacracy. The board then adopts a policy that mandates Holacracy as the operating system for the company and appoints the initial Lead Link of the Anchor Circle. Then it's Holacracy all the way down from there. In their case, the board is mostly pro-forma (it's legally required to have a board).&nbsp;Almost all of its work is delegated into the GCC.</p></dd>
