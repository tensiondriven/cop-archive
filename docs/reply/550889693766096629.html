  <dd><p>Hi Yves, I once applied holacracy in my own&nbsp;consulting team. And we experimented with a client circle as well as a project circle as well as a team circle. With lots of +/- on each of them in our experience. we found that the complexity and intensity of the project work we did as a consults hugely benefited from diversification of a single consulting role.</p><p>happy to talk you through it. just send me a DM and we connect.</p><p>Koen</p></dd>
