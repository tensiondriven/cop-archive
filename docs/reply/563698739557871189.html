  <dd><p>Hi Monica, hi everybody,</p><p>I had the opportunity to speak with you Monica about my interest to take part to the development of holacracy in Spain, and I confirm it here. Thanks for your initiative and I would be happy to participate&nbsp;in a virtual meeting with other people interested as you propose.</p><p>I'm preparing the assessment too.
