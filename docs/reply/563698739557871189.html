  <dd><p>Hi Monica, hi everybody,</p><p>I had the opportunity to speak with you Monica about my interest to take part to the development of holacracy in Spain, and I confirm it here. Thanks for your initiative and I would be happy to participate&nbsp;in a virtual meeting with other people interested as you propose.</p><p>I'm preparing the assessment too. I live in the Bask country, and I can share the experience of the Spanish representation of the NGO Surfrider Foundation Europe, based in San Sebastian and Barcelona : we adopted holacracy in November 2016 in this team, and we would really like to connect with other organizations practicing or wiling to do so in Spain.</p><p>Buen dia a todos</p></dd>
