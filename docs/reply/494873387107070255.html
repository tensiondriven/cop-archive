  <dd><p>@&nbsp;Marlene, I find this a very interesting issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; My question is: Why do you have the roles Office Care Taker and Team Event Organiser? They probably were an answer on a tension and do have a purpose&nbsp; that is&nbsp;alligned with the&nbsp;organizations purpose. If so, how does your tension&nbsp;relate to the purposes of those roles and to the purpose of the organization?</p><p>We as role fillers have our personal needs to fulfill our roles the best we can. To take good membership in the organization and enact our roles purposes and accountabilities it is sometimes necessary to satisfy some "personal" needs. So we cn be more present for our roles.&nbsp;Maybe you can solve this with with a proposal for a policy?</p><p>I realy would like to hear from others about this subject.</p></dd>
