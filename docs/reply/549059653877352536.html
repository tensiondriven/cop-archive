  <dd><p>following Tom his quote: the idea of Holacracy is not to make the former "manager" less powerfull, but to make everybody as powerful as the "managers" were</p><p>(else I would not advice Holacracy to any of my clients. Its good to get rid of the management&nbsp;<em>function</em> but the people previously in that function you typically want to remail powerful as you designated them in that role for a reason, probably because you find them quite capable. so lets not reduce the power they have)</p></dd>
