  <dd><p>Hi there - I was asked to bring a tension on behalf of someone one time to a meeting and it completely backfired. Actually, the person who asked me to bring the tension didn't support the proposal I suggested to solve "his problem" .. I vowed to myself to never bring another tension that wasn't mine to the meeting. Recall that tensions are&nbsp;effectively processed only when the tension-holder "has what they need".&nbsp;With them not present, it may&nbsp;create inefficiency in use of meeting time if the depth of their concerns are not addressed. I suppose a person who can't make the meeting can ask someone else to bring the tension to the group that they anticipate is not going to be controversial. Otherwise, if he/she is looking for another person to "float" a hot potato, I would recommend&nbsp;passing that one back and&nbsp;not wasting your circle's valuable meeting time.</p></dd>
