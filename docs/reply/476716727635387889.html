<p>Since constitution 4.1 (or 4.0, I don't remember), there are rules to facilitate integration. Before, it was difficult for a Facilitator and he needed to heroically help the members to integrate.</p><p>With section 3.2.6., it is now very easy not to get stuck in integration:</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 19"><p>3.2.6 RULES OF INTEGRATION</p><p>When an Objection to a Proposal is raised, the following additional rules apply during the search for a resolution:</p><p>(a) The Facilitator must test an Objection if requested by any Core Circle Member, and discard it if it fails to meet the validity criteria described in this Section.</p><p>(b) The Objector must attempt to find an amendment to the Proposal that will resolve the Objection and still address the Proposer’s Tension. Others may help. If the Facilitator concludes that the Objector is not making a good faith effort to find a potential amendment at any point, then the Facilitator must deem the Objection abandoned and continue processing the Proposal as if the Objection had not been raised.</p><p>(c) Any Core Circle Member may ask the Proposer clarifying questions about the Tension behind the Proposal, or about any examples the Proposer shared to illustrate the Tension. If the Facilitator concludes that the Proposer is not making a good faith effort to answer those questions at any point, then the Facilitator must deem the Proposal invalid for processing and abandoned.</p></div>  </div>
