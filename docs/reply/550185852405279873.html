<p>[@mention:508243854762339714] Wow, that's a lot to unpack.&nbsp; I'm going to follow your bullet points in a quick-hit response and Bernard-Marie or others may have their own thoughts.</p><p>Bullet #1 - Got it</p><p>Bullet #2 - This sounds like it may be a bad structure.&nbsp; Circle 2's accountabilities do not need to *specifically* mention the accountabilities of Circle 4, but there should be an alignment as you move through the nested circles of the structure.&nbsp; Circle 4 sounds like it may have been out of place.&nbsp; An issue here is whether Circle 2 had the authority to create Circle 4 (via it's sub-circle, Circle 3).</p><p>Bullet #3 - This sounds like a circle in need of some coaching (or realignment or disbandment), but those issues are beyond the scope of this thread.</p><p>Bullet #4 - This sounds like a circle in need of some coaching (or realignment or disbandment), but those issues are beyond the scope of this thread.</p><p>Bullet #5 - Got it.&nbsp; S/he may also need some coaching.</p><p>Bullet #6 - This sounds like a positive step.&nbsp; Circle 2's LL should have a tension about this and the strategy meetings strike me as an OK approach.</p><p>Bullet #7 - Here's where we get to the crux of this particular thread.&nbsp; It sounds to me like Circle 2's lead link's actions were far beyond the scope of his/her authority.&nbsp; The lead link can't restructure his/her circle alone; that is a decision of the circle that must be made through the governance process.&nbsp; Have you seen the warning notice when a non-secretary tries to open a meeting in GlassFrog?&nbsp; That's a good, simple clue about the limits on authority of circle members (including the lead link) to change the circle's governance on their own.</p><p>So, with regard to Bullet #7, what to do?&nbsp; [@mention:449833773917801859] is a far better guide here than I am, but my reaction would have to take into account who the people involved are and how long ago this happened.&nbsp; At the least, it seems that several members of the GCC, who all seemed willing to let this happen, need coaching/instruction on the scope of LL authority.&nbsp; If it was recent and if it is feasible, you could consider asking the GCC secretary/Circle 2 secretary to strike the invalid governance (see Constitution 3.4.4).&nbsp; In any event, I would emphasize how important it is to all circle members that the lead link not overstep his/her authority.&nbsp; Some circle members may not be comfortable saying something to the lead link due to power dynamics, and behavior like this can breed resentment and undermine your Holacracy implementation.</p><p>So those are my quick thoughts -- curious to hear from others, and good luck!</p>  </div>
