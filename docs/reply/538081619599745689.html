  <dd><p>Thank you all for your feedback!&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, so far our CEO (GCC lead link) holds a role in determining if a&nbsp;contract should be renewed or not. Usually, he also approves new hiring plan. We are in the process of giving sub-circles more authority in terms of getting new resources. My worry is that sub-circles won't see the big picture, therefore, I think having one role define a hiring strategy and make decisions on which resources are needed would be the best option.&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds like this doesn't conflict with GCC LL role's accountability. I will propose it in governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p><p>Xuan&nbsp;</p></dd>
