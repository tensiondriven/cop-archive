  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. To give you more insight of that situation : The upper circle is the GCC.</p><p>1. Historically speaking, some roles in that circle are not really connected together (was already the case in the previous hierarchical situation) and some are not in&nbsp;the heart of the GCC main purpose</p><p>2.&nbsp;Some of those roles became big enough to be mutated into circle.</p><p>@Jean-Michel, I&nbsp;understand the idea of "should be clearly separated". But as they are initially in the GCC,&nbsp;I don't see right away how I should/could propose this, and where should I "send" those !</p></dd>
