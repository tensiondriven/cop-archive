  <dd><p>As a GTD Master Trainer and Coach and a complete nut on integration etc, I can recommend 2 products. For true GTD Implementations, I find Todoist comes a little short &nbsp;for my students, I recommend Nirvana HQ its a well implemented GTD List management software that really helps support the practice. Secondly I personally use Toodledo and have for years its not pretty but its the most versatile list management software I know. It completely supports my practice and is flexible to support not only actions and projects but you higher horizons as well&nbsp;</p></dd>
