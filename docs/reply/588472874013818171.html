  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Bernard Marie Chiquet posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;As written in the Constitution (Section 5.2.1) "The Ratifiers may appoint an initial Lead Link". If any Lead Link, nothing is said re the decision process to choose/select such Lead Link. So back to your question, it's up to the Ratifiers to define such process, could be an integrative election, a vote,&nbsp; something else. Very often, what I have seen in my experience is as simple as they just choose the same decision process the usually use for other decision as a Partnership or Board.</p><p>It is sometimes weird to select&nbsp;only one Lead Link. One of our clients has a Board with 3 Business Partners who decide together re all important issues of the company. Adopting Holacracy meant for them that they&nbsp;had to select one Lead Link for the GCC when they would have naturally preferred to get 3. I'm confident that version 5 of the Constitution would allow for such an option.</p></div></blockquote><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859]</p><p>When you say "had to select one Lead Link", what about choosing&nbsp;to go <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without</span> any Lead Link. And leave all LL operational decisions to the IDM process in governance ?&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art522" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.2</a>)</p><p>Therefore,&nbsp;regarding having 3 LL: following the idea of having the anchor circle without LL, what about creating&nbsp;a role with all the Anchor circle Lead Link authorities (inc. <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art524" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">section 5.2.4</a>), and assigning all of the 3 business partners&nbsp;to that role ?</p></dd>
