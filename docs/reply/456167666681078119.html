  <dd><p>Hi Fajar,&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for the complex question! This is a great questions to ask during an on-line session of Coaches "Office Hours". This is a premium offering that includes a trial period to see if the membership better suites your needs with Holacracy. You can learn more about Premium <a href="/about" target="_blank">here</a>. We will be scheduling Office Hours in mid/late September so keep an eye out for the announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
