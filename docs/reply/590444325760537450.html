  <dd><p>Fritz,</p><p>I agree that there is no need to achieve&nbsp;higher levels unless it meets business goals. I guess I was making the assumption that the higher up the trajectory the "better" we are doing... as you say, that might not be the case. Certainly if where we are is working for us, there may be no need to change.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank&nbsp;you for helping me to pause and consider that!</p><p>I wondering&nbsp;if anybody has tied moving up those levels to&nbsp;something they are measuring.&nbsp; It sounds like&nbsp;you are not.&nbsp; We are in the process of starting some coordinated strategic planning discussions with an outside facilitator&nbsp;and will report back here&nbsp;if and when we have&nbsp;ideas to push this forward.</p><p>In the meantime, if anyone else has evaluation&nbsp;ideas or examples, I would appreciate hearing about them.</p><p>Sam</p></dd>
