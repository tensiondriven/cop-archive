  <dd><p>Characterizing it as a feeling rather than a construct clicked for me.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think colloquially you can "feel a gap", or better yet, "a potential". I'm not sure the word literally referring to a sense-perception is necessary to meaningfully characterize it as a feeling. If so, I think "potential" might have some advantages to Stephen's point.</p><p>Our implementation is very new, however, and it's not something I feel clear about at all. Not hard to imagine "tension" proving to be superior over the longer term.</p></dd>
