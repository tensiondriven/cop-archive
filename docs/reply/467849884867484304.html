  <dd><p>Davi - sounds like you are aware that accountabilities don't limit.</p><p>Meaning just because Feature Developer is accountable for Selecting stories from the backlog (or whatever) that doesn't limit them or other roles from doing development work based on their best judgment. In other words roles can go above and beyond accountabilities which you want. Without some constraints the developers could still just develop what they want if it serves their role's purpose. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Since&nbsp;with software development you do want a centralized iteration planning, either&nbsp;a domain for development priorities on a role - Product Owner - or the circle policy you mentioned would complete the workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>Makes complete sense to evolve your process and have two separate repos and even prioritizations at play. Keep us posted!</p></dd>
