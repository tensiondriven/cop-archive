  <dd><p>I can share what I do as the Rep Link of Ecosystem Circle within H1: people comes to me and expose their tensions (tensions they can't process within the circle itself because it is broader than that). I try to understand it and have a skype to dive in further and then I make a proposal out of governance. If it is escalated, I'll come to the next governance meeting.</p><p>Though I think I could have some value attending tactical meetings but I don't have the time because of client engagements. It might be a good opportunity to represent the Ecosytem and have a voice at the GCC directly.</p><p>If your tension is that Rep Links don't quite know how to manage their role, you could organize sessions between Rep Links where they can share their best practices. A good sign, in a early Holacracy practice, is when Rep Links attend meetings of the Super Circle even if they don't bring any tension.</p></dd>
