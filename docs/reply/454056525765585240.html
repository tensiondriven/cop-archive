<p>At Telus partners we now have a work discovery process we use to determine the work done and thus the starting structure. We use 3 initial 2hr meetings to discover the work. The first meeting is uncovering it, the second meeting is clustering it and the third meeting is with the potential lead link in defining the initial roles/sub circles from the clustered work. Once completed we kick of an introductory day with the first governance and tactical. I have used this process a number of times now and it really helps to focus the team on structuring the circle on the work being done and not existing position descriptions etc. Its always hard to start off but through the process of focusing on the work I have now had many successful circle kick offs that we find really helps get over the initial hurdles of peoples fusion to their position and focus on the work/roles and not the people.</p>  </div>
