  <dd><p>Hi Karileen,&nbsp;You have&nbsp;perfectly understood our challenge :-)&nbsp;The&nbsp;cross over is quite intensive as our organisation is leading&nbsp;several projects which have impact in the whole non-practicising organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that we have a translation job to do and we don't want to have all the burden on the shoulders of the ratifier. Rather than an orientation about the challenge we need&nbsp;simple methods to make our role structure clear to the non-practicioners so that they can get easily what they need from the right person/role, if possible without having to confront them with glassfrog/holaspirit. best, philippe</p></dd>
