  <dd><p>And also, one thing: at the beginning, as a Coach, I would not test the proposals, just because Holacracy is hard enough and the governance process is already very complex so if a person brings a tension, I don't want to stop her directly and get her frustrated with the process. If she brings a change, it is already great and before, in previous versions of the Constitution, this paragraph didn't even exist, we couldn't test the proposals.</p><p>It is very useful though if you have a some&nbsp;people with great mental ideas coming from their background but not grounded on the company's reality, to prevent them from spoiling your governance records with “might happen” kind of stuff.</p><p>The goal is not to prevent tensions from being processed, but rather to put clarity on the fact that it is based on a reality, a concrete situation (a tension is a gap between what IS and what could be) and that it does limit the organization because the person is sensing it in her roles and she works in it on a day-to-day basis.
