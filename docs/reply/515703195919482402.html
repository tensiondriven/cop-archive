  <dd><p>Yep, several of them.</p><p>One is the delegation (by a Policy) of establishing strategies to a strategy meeting process in lieu et place of Leal Link authority to do so. We use that one within iGi and some of the clients we've implemented Holacracy with.</p><p>Another is delegation of assigning Partners to the Circle's Roles for specific Role(s) to another Role or an process like the Integrative Election Process.</p><p>Another one is delegation of "Allocating the Circle's Ressource across its various Projects and/or Roles to another specifically created Role with one of our client - in this case the Lead Link has most of the skills for being a great Lead Link except the capacity of allocating ressources - so during the time required for this person filling the Lead Link Role to learn that new skill, a new adhoc Role has been created through governance.</p><p>There are more but these are le most popular examples I have encountered during 40+ implementations.&nbsp;</p></dd>
