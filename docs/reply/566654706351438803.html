  <dd><p>Interesting! My interpretation of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art335">Constitution Article 3.3.5</a>&nbsp;is a bit different as il the situation you describe, Sec. and Proposer are the same personn - so IMO there would be no "out-of-turn comments, nor attempts to engage others in a dialog or exchange of any sort, and nor reactions to other reactions instead of to the Proposal.‚Äù</p><p>And I would not allow that as a Facilitator because&nbsp;it would be weird for next&nbsp;participants during the Reaction Round to be asked to react to a Proposal&nbsp; being amended at the same time!</p><p>May be some further clarification to be added into 3.3.5...</p></dd>
