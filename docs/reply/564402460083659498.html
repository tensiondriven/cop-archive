I read your publication "Understanding Policies" and the related one you give links to within. In "Understanding Policies", I wonder how we could deal with an example you give.&nbsp;</p><p>You write : "Similarly a policy like, “Any role that gets an email request from a customer must submit it to customer service,” would also be invalid on the grounds that I don’t have control over whether or not I get contacted by someone else."</p><p>I wonder how we could achieve this result "any role that gets an email request from a customer must submit it to customer service" if we think it's useful and solve a tension, using an appropriate way ?&nbsp;</p><p>Have a good day</p></dd>
