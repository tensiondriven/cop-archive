So then the question is that how well the idea was “pitched and sold” to the team?</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>-Or do you mean trust from the group dynamics point of view?<br /><br />So that people trust each other because they see&nbsp;colleques&nbsp;as a friends/brothers/sisters who they CAN and WANT to rely on?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>(Compared to loose teams, eg. people going to work in a factory just to get bills paid)</div><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
