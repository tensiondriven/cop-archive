  <dd><p>[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;- key here is to separate&nbsp;<strong>Not Valid Governance Input</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Non Valid Governance Output</strong>. The initial example you gave was not valid&nbsp;<strong>input</strong>. because governance is only about things you sense from a role. although technically the <strong>output&nbsp;</strong>can be valid as a policy which I guess is your second post about...</p><p>the extravagant example just as an illustration why it is awkward to have these kind of proposals in governance and hence the reason for the&nbsp;<strong>non valid governance input&nbsp;</strong>clause in the constitution.</p><p>re - your statement: "But what if I state that having a market conform level will show to the market&nbsp;that we are a well respected and&nbsp;&nbsp;firm organization that cares for his people. Then my roles are impacted and am I able to better express my roles." - if you have an HR role that is about attracting new people I can link it to your role. But I would find it hard to make this statement for a "website developer" role. Then you can just trust Holacracy that there are other roles in the organization that care about this from an organizational perspective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
