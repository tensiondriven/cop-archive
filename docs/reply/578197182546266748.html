  <dd><p>Really like your reply, Brian. I notice that it involves stepping away from the usual reactions (anger, frustration, blame, punishment) typical of interactions in traditional organisations, and seeks information through simple questions, in order to get data about what happened, and partners' responses.</p><p>In effect, it is a means of getting partners back on one of the Holacracy pathways, each of which has a clear process which can be used to resolve a tension. Also, you have not minimised how tricky and difficult things can get. The lesson is the same, for the 'easy' as well as the apparently intractable - find a process, and trust it.</p><p>In other words, staying on the Holacracy path might be very hard to do sometimes, but it is always better than being off the path!</p><p>Ian</p></dd>
