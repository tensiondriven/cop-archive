  <dd><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>could it be that the only purpose of some organisation is to not exist?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">My answer is no - and may be I'm wrong - For me the Purpose of an Org. is the deep reason why it exists from an evolutionary perspective. So, as one Org. exists, it has a "Raison d'Ãªtre".</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>P.S. Or, perhaps, a company culturally isn't ready for Holacracy adoption, and if you never stop it will eventually go bankrupt?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;">Different subjects for me behind your question. As I like to say Holacracy is not for everyone, every Org. , every culture.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">And re going bankrupt, we've a case of a company we've helped implemented Holacracy some years ago that went bankrupt. &nbsp;They would say and I agree, that this was not due to Holacracy adoption.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p></dd>
