  <dd><p>Absolutely - and it can be a great exercise for them to articulate the roles that they are doing. Usually it is something, and not just manager. As Margaux said, it would be difficult to assign a Lead Link to someone who didn't fill key roles in the circle. It is also desirable to fill roles or be able to so that you can better make role assignments, back up roles, give feedback to enhance fit for role, restructure roles, etc.</p></dd>
