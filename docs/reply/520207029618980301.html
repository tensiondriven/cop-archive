  <dd><p>Hi Yang,</p><p>Chapter 5 of the Constitution will give you a few landmarks... You may also refer to the Holacracy Book.</p><ol><li>The LL of the GCC is appointed by the LL of the anchor circle (or, if any LL, by the anchor circle through an IDM process decision).</li><li>Up to you to create the Anchor Circle from the existing board. Each member will have to ratify the constitution.</li><li>Actually, your questions sound to be... tensions. Seems you need to build the proper apps to fit your needs.</li></ol><p>Hope that helps,<br /> Jean-Michel</p></dd>
