<p>Hi,</p><p>I would suggest that you try to find out what the tension is, in a open being-curious kind of way. Maybe the former management colleague has a valid tension but has difficulty to process it the new way and falls back in old behaviour. Maybe it's a personal tension but he/she needs help to recognise this and let go. And you could also ask if it is safe enough to try and give it a shot and not kill the idea right away. That's the great thing of this agile model, you can adjust all the time.</p><p>As a former higher manager myself I may sometimes show old behaviour and it helps if the questions are open and help me find out what the tension really is about. It's not always easy to let go of control and his/her&nbsp;intention may not be to harm the process but a genuine feeling that the action is&nbsp;not good for the organisation.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
