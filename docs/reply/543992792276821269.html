  <dd><p>Wayne,</p><p>Great question. &nbsp;I will take a stab at a possible tension around office space might be resolved.</p><p>Tension: People keep moving around and Facilities Caretaker (Role) has no idea when groups/people move from one area to the next.</p><p>A possible way to resolve in&nbsp;Governance.</p><p>Propose that the Domain (think office space or facilities) of Office Layout be defined for/granted to the Facilities&nbsp;Caretaker Role or Facilities Circle (if there were one). &nbsp;The Role or Circle would then have authority to create a Policy that let&nbsp;the rest of the organization know how they could or could not impact the Domain.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Policy: Office moves</p><p>Any team member may move to any open office space, so long as they get prior approval from @Facilities Caretaker.</p><p>This example is&nbsp;by no means a perfect proposal, but I hope it helps you process your tension.</p><p>- Dennis</p></dd>
