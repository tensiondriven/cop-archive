<p>Holacracy makes that reality easier to manage, not less, compared with management hierarchy.&nbsp; Here's a simple thought experiment to illustrate:&nbsp; If it really makes sense, you could create one role, named "Manager", and another role, named "Subordinate"; give the Manager role an accountability for "Directing the work of the Subordinate", and give the Subordinate an accountability for "Doing whatever the Manager says"; you've&nbsp;then recreated a very similar structure as a management hierarchy, all within Holacracy's ruleset - and that's completely valid to do.&nbsp; Holacracy doesn't prevent you from doing things like that when they make sense to do; it's just that they rarely make sense to do, and what Holacracy does is force you to clarify the structure and evolve it to make more sense over time.&nbsp; If it really does make sense to have something closer to that in part of the company, fine - have something closer to that.&nbsp; Or if it really makes sense to have a "Mentor" role or something to&nbsp;focus on helping people develop competencies, fine, have that.&nbsp; Or perhaps what makes sense is an "Expert" role combined with a policy that says no one may make certain major decisions without sign-off from Expert, but are otherwise free to lead their roles as they see fit.&nbsp; Again, the point here isn't that any of these specific solutions are necessarily a good idea&nbsp;in your case, but just that any of them are possible, or just about anything else you can dream up (or evolve into).&nbsp;&nbsp;Holacracy is just a framework to clarify how work should work and evolve it over time; you can&nbsp;define nearly any power structure within that framework that makes sense for the business.</p>  </div>
