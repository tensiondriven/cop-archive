  <dd><p>To echo and add on to Bernard Marie's comment, I'd also say this: you only want enough accountabilities to address tensions that have arisen. &nbsp;You are never trying to "document a role" in Holacracy - you are letting tensions drive accountability clarity. When you first start with Holacracy, you want your roles to be super light-weight - just one purpose or one accountability is enough, and you don't want too much more than that. &nbsp;Then, let tensions drive more clarity over time.</p></dd>
