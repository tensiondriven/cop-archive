  <dd><p>Arif - I don't understand (or share) that interpretation.&nbsp; The constitution doesn't say&nbsp;a Lead Link can go beyond the requirements of&nbsp;the constitution, or anything like that.&nbsp; It says he can appoint circle members beyond the ones required by the constitution; so there are some members required by the constitution, and then a lead link can add additional ones.&nbsp; The lead link still must be serving the lead link role to do so; it does not say the person filling the lead link role can do so, it says the lead link can do so, and that's defined as "when acting in the capacity of the role".</p></dd>
