  <dd><p>[@mention:549200391377900110]&nbsp;It's true that it's not obvious and could be clearer (you can propose improvements <a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution" target="_blank">here</a>!) But the key is in the constitution.</p><p>Several rules of the constitution&nbsp;are tied to the Secretary or, to use&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353]'s example, to the Lead Link.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, a governance&nbsp;meeting is only valid if the Secretary has called it:</p><blockquote><h4>3.3.2 Notice &amp; Quorum</h4><p>A Circle may only conduct its Governance Process in a meeting if the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary</span> has given all Core Circle Members reasonable advance notice that a Governance Meeting will be held, including its time and location.</p></blockquote><p>Or metrics are only required if&nbsp;the Lead Link has assigned&nbsp;them:</p><blockquote><h4>4.1.1 Duty of Transparency</h4><p>... <strong>(d) Checklist Items &amp; Metrics:</strong>&nbsp;... You must also track and report on any metrics assigned to your Roles by the Circle’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lead Link</span>, or by any other Role or process granted the authority to define the Circle’s metrics.</p></blockquote></dd>
