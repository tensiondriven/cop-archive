  <dd><p>Thanks Jean-Michel,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Creating the President role fitting the legal requirement sounds like a great idea. Well done ! We will certainly go this way now.</p><p>My initial issue came from I've always heard that the CEO (if CEO there is...) can "stop playing the game" at any time, which I wanted to avoid. It would be a shame to start a beautiful and successful business and see one person going fancy one day and wanting to remove&nbsp;the rules, legally !</p><p>But I believe it may not happen, due to Holacracy actually, which allows every one to feel soooooo good working for the company that it may never occur !</p><p>Thanks to all for your answers that have definitely helped to go around my personal projection...??? &nbsp;<img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Fabien</p></dd>
