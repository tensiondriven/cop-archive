  <dd><p>Great topic Keely and wow, beautifully&nbsp;phrased Gerald. And I totally agree. In our company, synnervate, we use 'complimentary practices' for all relational stuff. For us it is very helpful to admit that even when clarity is great, being fully present in relations is the biggest challenge...</p><p>At the moment we find Functional Subgrouping (a part of System Centered Training) very beneficial. Spiral Dynamics is also an important way for us to understand and deepen our relations.</p></dd>
