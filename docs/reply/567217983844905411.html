  <dd><p>[@mention:456308404149183518]&nbsp;Ah, yes, I can see why that would be confusing.&nbsp;</p><p>"Chart it," is my way of saying, "Let's take this into integration" (i.e. I think it passes all of the criteria). I don't ever say the words "valid objection," because I may have to retest it in integration.</p><p>Version&nbsp;4.1 of the Consitution says, "take all valid objections..." but I've pitched for the next version to say, "<strong>Don't</strong> take any <strong>invalid</strong> objections," because there is a slight but important difference.&nbsp;</p><p>I also usually write down an objection before testing it, so saying "chart it" could be confusing. But in practice, with the objection already written, if I say, "Let's chart that...any other objections?" it works well enough because I erase any once it's clear they're invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
