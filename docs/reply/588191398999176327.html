  <dd><p>[@mention:568484858377802720]&nbsp;You're right, Holacracy is about a purpose driven organization. Notice that Lead Link is a Role that covers functions required for leading a Circle. Per default in Constitution 4.1, one person fills such Role, but you may change that by distributing such functions on different Roles or processes. For instance, you could decide (by adding a Policy) to elect all the&nbsp;Roles within a Circle, if this was the way used before Holacracy adoption.</p></dd>
