  <dd><p>Hi Tim,</p><p>If you need an on going activity to be done on a regular basis, creating a role with one accountability may be enough (e.g. keeping up to date accounts books). Very often, at this starting point, the purpose of the role is not clearly defined.</p><p>On another way, the role may be created to reach a goal (e.g. unforgettable experience for delighted customers) with any idea about the way to do that, and a single purpose will be enough to inspire the role holder.</p><p>Actually, the initial tension drives the role proposal.</p><p>Regards<br /> Jean-Michel</p></dd>
