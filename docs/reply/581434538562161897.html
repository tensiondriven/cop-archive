  <dd><blockquote><div><p>Hi David,</p><p>It is good to see the reference to Matrix Insights. I am one of the founders and have introduced it to Holacracy One,&nbsp;<a href="http://encode.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encode.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Evolution at Work as well as in traditional organizations. I do know that there&nbsp;are&nbsp;other Holacracy-based organizations actively using it, so maybe they will chime in.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, it is most effective it if is woven into a set of interpersonal practices and agreements. And it really helps to have someone who is very knowledgeable about the lenses on which it is based to take it beyond just looking up suggestions. That expertise (internally or externally-contracted) helps keep it from becoming too stereotypic as well as deepening the practices that it helps support. It also helps to use the differences as a language to be more understanding.&nbsp;</p><p>At&nbsp;<a href="http://encode.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encode.org</a>&nbsp;I offer it in support of my Guild Leadership. We use opt-in Guilds as a way to develop various skills needed to work together well and to work independently. As part of the Honoring Differences Guild, I know some people use it regularly. Others not so much. In our guild meetings we explore the Interaction Styles, Essential Motivators, and Cognitive Dynamics lenses to better understand ourselves as well as to unpack conflicts that occur.&nbsp; (Interaction Styles and Essential Motivators are lenses used in Matrix Insights where there are many suggestions for relationships and personal development). Based on feedback I've receive<strong>d</strong>, the&nbsp;Guild members use the lenses without Matrix Insights and find them helpful.</p><p>Does it power Holacratic working? The use of the various&nbsp;lenses on individual differences makes a big difference in helping people recognize their superpowers, workstyles, learning styles, as well as&nbsp;what energizes them and therefore how to better energize their roles. This helps them&nbsp;be more autonomous and self-directed as well as making space for others to be likewise.&nbsp; Honoring these differences can help speed up the learning curve when implementing Holacracy and even deal with resistances.&nbsp;</p><p>The lenses are powerful on their own. Adding in&nbsp;Matrix Insights, you have a very useful, on demand tool to help you recognize individual differences so you can find sources of interpersonal tensions, then get them out of the way of resolving the organizational tensions.&nbsp;</p><p>As to how do you&nbsp;find&nbsp;it?&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>f you are referencing where to get it, you can go to&nbsp;<a href="http://matrixinsights.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MatrixInsights.com</a>&nbsp;or you can contact me directly. I hope to be covering some of this at the Holacracy Forum&nbsp;where I have applied to present about it. I look forward to hearing comments from others who use it.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Linda</p></div></blockquote></dd>
