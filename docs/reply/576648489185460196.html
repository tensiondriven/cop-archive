  <dd><p>Hi Jean-Luc,</p><p>That's a very interesting point you bring. I would say yes and no. It's the Proposer's aim to resolve his Tension so (A) and he does not need to be very mindful of his ecology as the system assumes that all other members will be frank and will give objections when they sense the Proposal harm some part of the organisation. In this regards it is in a way a collective intelligence process (B) but quite heavily moderated. Also in the integration round there is space for more emergence and collaboration on finding a good solution.</p><p>I'm just curious from where does your question come from? It it curiosity or is it a result of something else?</p><p>Cheers!</p></dd>
