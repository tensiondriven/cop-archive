  <dd><p>With regard to only Secretary and Lead Link having the ability to fill Roles, what does someone do if the Lead Link and Secretary are both absent to a meeting in Glass Frog, or the Secretary hasn't been assigned yet and so only the Lead Link can do it and they are absent for that meeting? How does someone else fill in for them for that one meeting in Glass Frog? Does the Lead Link have to give their password to their GF account to someone else to fill roles from the Lead Link's GF account for that one meeting? Or is there a way of automatically having some other Role take over for Lead Link in the GF software in the event of an absence?</p><p>Thanks. P</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
