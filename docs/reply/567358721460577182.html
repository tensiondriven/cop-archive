  <dd><p>Great question. Hadn't thought of it before. : )&nbsp;</p><p>For Governance, I think the timebox fits within my interpretation of what "reasonable notice" means.&nbsp;You stop processing when the meeting time ends&nbsp;because "notice" only covered the time specified.&nbsp;</p><p>For Tacticals, 4.2.3(e) says, "The Facilitator must attempt to allow time for processing every agenda item within the meeting, and in order to do so may cut off the processing of any item thatâ€™s taking more than its due share of the remaining meeting time."</p></dd>
