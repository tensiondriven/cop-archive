  <dd><p>Elena, I am familiar with Luhmann and also don't recommend that people read him ha, -- not easy reading! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> However it does speak to the self replicating nature of systems, and it sheds light on the difficulty we have when changing our relational or social dynamics / systems. Holacracy creates a natural disruption to all of these dynamics, so some support in this area is needed. Not all are interested in changing relationships, dynamics, or working through it though.</p></dd>
