  <dd><p>I have a couple of clarifying questions. What is the purpose of the Anchor Circle (e.g. board)? Is the 2nd proposed circle part of the Company? What role perse in the Anchor Circle are you looking to expand into a 2nd Circle? The answers provide a bit more context to understand your specific situation.</p></dd>
