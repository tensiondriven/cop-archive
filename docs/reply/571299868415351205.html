  <dd><p>[@mention:544274267239861666]: It should work like you describe - unless you are already within the circle that you are trying to reference, then it shouldn't because you are already in the circle. Does that make sense? But, you may have&nbsp;encountered a bug, in which case, can you submit a bug here: <a href="https://glassfrog.com/support/," target="_blank">https://glassfrog.com/support/,</a> and give us the details of what you are trying to do and which circles/roles are involved?</p></dd>
