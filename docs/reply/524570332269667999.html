  <dd><p>Hi Gabi,</p><p>Hope you're well.</p><p>My interpretation is that if you ask someone to represent a tension for you it still has to be a tension from one of your roles to be valid. It sounds like in the case you described that the person was not sensing a tension from their role? In this case, they are able to ask the relevant role holder if the tension and proposed solution makes sense to them but that person is under no obligation to take on the advice.</p><p>Like Tracey, I think representing another role's tension is risky and would generally advise a role to make an asynchronous proposal or call a governance meeting to process their own tension.</p><p>If someone does ask another role to represent their tension at a meeting, it must still be grounded in a real situation and be sensed from one of their own roles.</p><p>Sally</p></dd>
