  <dd><p>Dasha, did you also read the book from Brian Robertson about Holacracy? Also a nice thing to read is the Comic Book made by [@mention:449833773917801859]. (<a href="http://igipartners.com/en/read-holacracy-comic-book-free#page-1" target="_blank"><a href="http://igipartners.com/en/read...mic-book-free#page-1" target="_blank">http://igipartners.com/en/read...mic-book-free#page-1</a></a>)</p><p>My advise is to&nbsp;attend the Practioner Training as this is a great way to learn Holacracy. Also you will meet several other interested people that might be of help to you.</p><p>To train my skills I became part of an online Practice group. These are groups of people that practice online the Facilitation part of Holacracy. Not only a good place to practice (or just&nbsp;to observe and learn)&nbsp;but also lots of knowledge is shared there. Get in contact with [@mention:493465881837995141]&nbsp;and she can provide you more details.</p><p>Also on this community you can find lots of information ;-)</p><p>Hopes this helps and I wish you a great journey into Holacracy.</p></dd>
