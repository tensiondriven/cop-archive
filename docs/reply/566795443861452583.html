  <dd><p>Louis, my answer is also NO. If the Proposer wants to amend his proposal, regardless of the roles he fills during the meeting, this needs to be done in the Amend &amp; Clarify round.</p><p>Also in the Reaction round the Proposer is the only one not to react. So by changing the Proposal it would be either in his Role as Proposer which is not allowed or in his role of Secretary, who has only the right to amend Proposals solely based on Proposers input (as mentioned in 3.3.5(d)).&nbsp;</p></dd>
