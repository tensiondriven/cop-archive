  <dd><p>My thoughts here are aligned with Margaux's - I'd use that power not to dictate the sub-circle's organization, but only to redraw the boundaries of the sub-circles (i.e. what functions are included in each; the scope of each) - which is part of the broader circle's self-organization. &nbsp;So, I think of it&nbsp;more&nbsp;like you're just moving an accountability from one sub-circle to another, but there happens to be a role that expresses that accountability that goes along with the move... hence the broader circle still doesn't care how the sub is organized, it's just moving whatever organization is already there from one place to another, then leaving it to each to further change that as-desired after the move. &nbsp;If someone tries to use&nbsp;this power not like&nbsp;this but&nbsp;to actually much in&nbsp;the sub-circle's organization, then you'd hope&nbsp;the rep link or lead link from that sub-circle would&nbsp;object...</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
