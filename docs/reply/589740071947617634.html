  <dd><p>[@mention:523162737680436711], if the project comes from tactical meeting of the super-circle, does it mean&nbsp;that LL is only forwarding the request to PM role? because LL will need to update the progress / status of the project for other role in the super circle project dashboard.</p><p>Also I am interested if other software development related circle using holacracy&nbsp;out there has different (better) approach. As the steps I mention above is pretty standard for software development house. My motivation of asking this is, to learn about how&nbsp;different is it before and after holacracy.</p></dd>
