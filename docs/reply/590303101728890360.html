  <dd><p>[@mention:523162737680436711], thanks for your response. My question is also that If i need a project to be intiaited by a role, do i have to go and talk to them to request or can I just add it in their glassfrog and let them see it, and then inquire about it from me or I have to first clarify. In other words, on the glassfrog, can some one else add a project for another role or the person themselves have to add the projects in their role?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
