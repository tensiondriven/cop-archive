  <dd><p>Cathy, Here is a quick answer for another perspective, even though it sounds like you will talk with Bernard Marie...</p><p>I tend to want to investigate why-- what happened, why are they not followed, is it a pattern, or a one off thing? Do people know about the policies?&nbsp;Often more tension processing, including perhaps some new/edited accountabilities, and subsequent projects may be needed to get in alignment with policies.&nbsp;</p><p>This may or may not be "as Lead Link" -- it depends on the tension around it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
