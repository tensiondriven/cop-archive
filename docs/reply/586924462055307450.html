<p>Bis on&nbsp;[@mention:451241754031062437]&nbsp;comments and I would add on it. Adopting Holacracy means a brutal change for everyone in the way I work - from "doing my job" to "managing each of my roles", the latter encompassing new things very clearly defined in Article 1 of the Constitution, such as for instance identifying the gaps between reality and an ideal in the implementation of the purpose or the accountabilities of my roles, which is pure thinking work: here we move from "doing my job" to "thinking about tensions".<br />This is to say that this change in social contract requires training, support and safe space for people to learn gradually.<br />A big difficulty I often encounter with the clients I work with is that the former leaders already have so much confidence and competence in this new way of working and have a hard time imagining the gap it represents for others.</p>  </div>
