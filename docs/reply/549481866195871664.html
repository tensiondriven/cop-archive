<p>A Policy allows or limits others from impacting a domain. In our organization we have a Team Happiness circle that has a domain of "partner relationships". We interpret "Partner Relationships" to include definition of benefits offered and things that would traditionally be included in an "employee handbook". Therefore our benefits are included as policies in the Team Happiness Circle. We put your first three bullet points as policies in the Team Happiness Circle.&nbsp;</p><p>Your fourth point regarding phone and computer we used to have a defined benefit policy in Team Happiness for Provided equipment, but now using the Spending Authorization process that would cover for that type of stuff so we deleted our Provided Equipment policy. Here is the conversation regarding the spending authorization app on the forum. <a href="/topic/holacracyone-s-spending-authorization-base-process-v1-0" target="_blank">...on-base-process-v1-0</a></p><p>The last one is a more complicated topic that I am not qualified nor have the energy to answer.</p>  </div>
