  <dd><p>Frederic Laloux once gave his answer to the same question asked by Ricardo Semler: only companies where the CEO had gone through some sort of personal transformation have been successful at this organisational transformation. A conviction that the metrics will look better, or a mental understanding of the organisational model (Holacracy or any other) is insufficient. In short: it needs the CEO's heart (or business unit leader in case of a part of the organisation) to feel the need to take this step forward.</p></dd>
