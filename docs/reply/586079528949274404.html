  <dd><p>Hi Margaux! What a great topic! The Unit where I used to work, was also distributed among several citys within three different language regions and experienced a great challenge trying to push the Holacracy Implementation, mantaining the purpose orientation, the motivation, etc. Tribe Space seems to be quite hard to be build and kept, when interaction is only virtual. Anyway, it would be great if we could collect and exchange best practices for this issue. We started the program "High five", which was a monthly meeting where everybody was invited to come personally and enjoy five different face to face formats. &nbsp;We coordinated to do a tactical and a governance meeting, an eat together, a share together and a work2gether.&nbsp; Of course, this means traveling and investing time and financial resources and not every company has the chance to invest on it. While considerating such an intervention it is good to think, that several studies confirmed that psychological safety and trust are main factors for the building and functioning of high performance teams. We also included questions to our online check-ins which allowed us to get to know each other in a new way, not only job-related (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/0...edding-or-small.html</a>). Investing in Tribe space may seem wasteful, but it might be a great investment on the performance, commitment, orientation of the team. I look forward to your own best practices! All the best, Eliana&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
