<p>Hi,</p><p>like this&nbsp;profound&nbsp;conversation about nuances of holarchic principles - thanks for all your perspectives and summaries, very helpful!</p><p>Here's my additional thoughts:</p><blockquote><p><em>Where a domain&nbsp;<strong>HAS</strong>&nbsp;been delegated to a circle/role, from super-circles all the way from the anchor circle, the domain (and any accompanying policies) applies to&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;roles in all circles of the organization.</em></p></blockquote><p class="p2">To my understanding domains and policies are holarchic (and affect all the circles down). Referring to&nbsp;Andrea's point about "the default domain not being considered a full fledged domain" and Nick's example of the Auto-accept time limit I would still interpret&nbsp;a GCC policy relevant for all sub-circles, even without an explicit domain, since it applies&nbsp;to&nbsp;"all activities and functions within the circle".&nbsp;</p><p class="p2">I still have a few practical&nbsp;questions: how can a spread of domain&nbsp;show up&nbsp;in Governance? The domain of circle B is&nbsp;visible at the "super-circle boundary" (ie the LL role representing the circle B in the super-circle A). Since the domain must stay visible at the circle boundary you can only grant authority&nbsp;to impact&nbsp;that domain for subcircles via a policy. And:&nbsp;a policy in Circle B that allows impacting a domain of Circle B for Circle D is&nbsp;delegated further downwards to a Sub-Circle of D via processing a change of the policy in Circle B e.g. via Rep Links. I wonder how transparent and easy to capture that is for circle members of D, since the policy is not part of the subcircle's governance but a few circles up. And how do circle members hold themselves well-informed about changes without screening Glassfrog records every morning. For larger org that can become really tricky.</p><p class="p2">Any thoughts / experiences on that?</p><p class="p2"><em>- Gerald</em></p>  </div>
