  <dd><p>Tyler,</p><p>I think a GlassFrog workaround is to "elect" someone to that role who you can then delete from your organization.&nbsp; This should leave the role unfilled.&nbsp; Or, you could create a member of the organization called "Intentionally Unfilled" and elect that account member to the role of rep link.&nbsp; Both of these would require admin privileges.</p><p>Kevin</p></dd>
