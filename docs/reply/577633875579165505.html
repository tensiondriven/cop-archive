  <dd><p>Thanks Chris.</p><p>I think that article of yours on Medium with the 8 videos might be what I needed to get a particular leader I know to consider that Holacracy could offer benefits to her Organization that Sociocracy often doesn't offer.</p><p>I find that Sociocracy people mistakenly either think the 2 governance styles are "the same thing" or that seeking consent is great and why would they want to do otherwise. I feel that your article and its videos showed how Holacracy really does "protect" every single little individual in the Organization to sense and express their Tensions, and to not be allowed to be squashed by an assertive charismatic person or "group-think".</p></dd>
