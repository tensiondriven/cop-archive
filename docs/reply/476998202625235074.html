  <dd><p>In Australia we have union representation via shop stewards in which case they are purely roles within the organisation. Other ways of dealing with it here is to use context reps that represent the external context within the appropriate circle within the organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Also for specific legal requirements it is purely done via policy relating to membership&nbsp;</p><p>hope that helps</p></dd>
