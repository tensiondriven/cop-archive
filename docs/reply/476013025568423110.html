My democratically run nonprofit organization, the <a href="http://www.theselc.org" target="_blank">Sustainable Economies Law Center</a>, uses holacracy as a template for our organization. We're working to create resources for nonprofits to institute more participatory/self-management systems into their workplaces, as well as democratic governance and worker control (as much as is legally possible). All of our internal policies are published online on our website under About Us --&gt; Our Governance at the top of our website.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd be interested to know if there are worker coops in NY that are using holacracy, too!</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>-Ricardo</p></div></blockquote><p>Ricardo --</p><p>Excellent. &nbsp;I'm also very interested in nonprofits running on Holacracy. &nbsp;I've been exploring the same at my organization here in NYC, but I'm afraid ultimately it will looks like me carving out a pocket of the org to use Holacracy meeting structures, a very partial implementation.</p><p>I'll check out your governance docs. &nbsp;I'd be excited about a resource that points nonprofits to self-management as well.</p><p>Side note: I came across your org when we were researching new economy / cooperative economy work here at FPWA (<a href="http://www.fpwa.org" target="_blank">www.fpwa.org</a>). &nbsp;We've been at the center of securing the City Council investment in worker coops in NYC.</p><p>Cheers,<br />Michael</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
