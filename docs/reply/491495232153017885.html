  <dd><p>Hey Giuseppe,</p><p>It's important to have one clear project owner. Someone who cares about the WHOLE thing. With that Role and project identified, then it's kinda up to that role how to manage the coordination. Maybe even use an external project tracker tool. BUT, one way I've seen that done well just using Glassfrog is to have smaller projects for the other roles. The projects could be something like, "Complete graphics sent to @Developer." Then, the Graphics role completely owns working towards that specific sub-outcome. I hope that makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, I'll emphasize that Glassfrog isn't intended to handle all project coordination, (just like it isn't intended to be a replacement for your own personal productivity system), so use an external program if necessary. From a Holacracy perspective, you're doing it right as long as there is one clear owner for the entire outcome. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
