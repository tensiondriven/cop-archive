  <dd><p>Responsibilities and duties are like Rights and Obligations.<br />Article 1.2 clarifies what a role is entitled to do (i.e. processing and tracking tensions, purpose, accountabilities and projects).<br />When you’re on your own, you don’t have any obligations towards others (because there is no ‘others’). In most organizations this is not the case. A role has been granted to you by another role (or circle). So there are ‘others’ (roles, members, partners). Even within a decentralized context of a for-the-purpose organization there must be some kind of coordinating mechanism. This is where obligations come into play (duties in article 4.1: transparency, processing, prioritization).<br /><br />It seems to me superfluous to have a purpose ‘enact [..] in order to realize the purpose of the organization’ (because that purpose was the reason that your role was established).<br />The same goes for ’taking into account the needs of other [..]’. The constitution is all about ’taking into account of others’; not for the sake of others, but for the purpose and based on clear and specific ruleset. 'Taking into account' can have a lot of different meanings, leading to more confusion (instead of solving it).<br /><br />..on the other hand; If your proposal will reduce the tension behind it (puzzlement around responsibilities and duties of roles and members), go for it.</p></dd>
