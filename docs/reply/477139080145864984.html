  <dd><p>Kieth,</p><p>Para 1.4 contains this definition of Policy:</p><p class="p1"><em>"You may also define “Policies” for your Domains, which are either grants&nbsp;of authority that allow others to control or cause a material impact within&nbsp;a Domain, or limits on how others may do so when otherwise authorized. &nbsp;Before a Policy is valid, you must first publish it in a forum convenient to all&nbsp;Partners who may be impacted."</em></p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Additionally, the following is from the glossary on the Holacracy App:</p><p class="p1"><em>Policy - A Policy allows or limits others from impacting a Domain. &nbsp;For example, if a "Social Media" Role owns the Domain of "corporate Twitter account" then a Policy might be enacted to allow "Events Promotion" Role to make posts to Twitter (e.g. "Events Promotion has permission to post events-related content to the corporate Twitter account")</em></p><p class="p1">I hope this helps.</p><p class="p1">- Dennis</p></dd>
