  <dd><p>[@mention:476716727643924128]: Thank you so much for your reply and advise, especially your going through each bullet point and providing feedback.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, there was a lot going on. I like the approach of asking&nbsp;Sec of Circle-Level 2 to strike the NVGO. It feels terrifying to me as most legacy c-suite executives hold roles in the Circle-level 1, and a few want to have role (or being Lead Link of a Circle-level 2) in order to sit in on Circle-level 1 meetings. I know this pattern is what Holacracy is built to address...It is still tough from where I see it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks!</p></dd>
