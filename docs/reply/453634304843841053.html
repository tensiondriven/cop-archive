  <dd><p>Hi Samantha, Most of this input is conceptual for me as I haven't started and org from scratch but having just come off a couple trainings, I can add a few bits here and hopefully others can as well.</p><p>Yes, best to start with fewer circles to begin with and let the work differentiate over time as it becomes. Better to let the governance process drive the structure via real tensions sensed and processed by the circle members, rather&nbsp;than designing up front.</p><p>More traditional functions may sit with the GCC level circle at first or be moved into a sub circle if there's enough activity and self contained work to split off into a separate circle. But, again, if it's not clear yet whether those functions needs to be broken off, consider keeping it at GCC until real tensions demonstrate further differentiation is needed. Of course, if all depends on how large the organization and how mature those functions are currently.</p><p>Hope that provides some initial guidance.</p><p>Eric</p></dd>
