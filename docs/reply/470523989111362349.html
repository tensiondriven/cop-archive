  <dd><p>I really hope this contributes to the ecosystem. The recent change in the pricing model of Glassfrog is an intelligent move&nbsp;and sets the bar pretty high for new challengers. Once the basic features become "mineral water" &nbsp;the value&nbsp;added features will&nbsp;make the difference in the positioning of each offer, and this will be good for all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>The API strategy and the integration with third party tools may be a key differentiator (the APi strategy of Holaspirit&nbsp;has not been defined yet, at least this was the situation last week)</p><p>(Speaking of language: I too&nbsp;had&nbsp;enquired about the language localization of Glassfrog, and reverted to creating an&nbsp;addendum to the italian constitution that would help non english speakers get a hold of some concepts in the UI, I am still available to provide support to the translation in my locale if needed, maintaining a&nbsp;coherence with the concepts and terminology of the italian version of the constitution. I am 100% sure that the localization is a piece of cake "codewise", probably just the editing of a few "properties files")</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>Andrea</p></dd>
