  <dd><p>[@mention:576648489231374882], thank you for your ideology-free reply. Your perspective is what I was looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific questions:<br />- did it require any amendments to the Constituiton?<br />- did it cause any specific policies/domains etc. in the GCC?</p><p>(Of course as far as you are willing to share those, if you prefer to do directly please PM me).</p><p>[@mention:456167666726491228], thanks for sharing - the book you mention is <a href="https://profitfirstbook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a>? It would be great to learn how that was incorporated into your governance.</p></dd>
