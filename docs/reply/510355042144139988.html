  <dd><p>All helpful, thanks - and not quite what I'm looking for. I do like the Glossary, I refer folks to it a lot, I just wish it said what it cannot be to remove the socialized conflation of the term policy to mean rules that *can* require action. &nbsp;</p><p>If 1.4 is the sole constitution-provided definition of Policy I think it needs greater clarity and expansion re: what a Policy can and cannot do.</p><p>I love the coaching tips and the comparisons - and I get it and got it at Practitioner and then Coach training - I personally know what a Policy 'ought' to be. &nbsp;</p><p>What I don't have is something written - in an official document like the constitution or addendum - and&nbsp;<em>is something&nbsp;concrete that I can point to for justification to strike invalid governance or propose replacement of policies that exceed these informal definitions</em>&nbsp;that says clearly that which all the coaching and comparisons say.</p><p>"Why do we have to replace all these policies (that require action not captured in work agreements, legacy policy or role accountabilities)?"</p><p>&nbsp; - um, because that's not what a policy is supposed to be.</p><p>"Where does it say anywhere that a policy cannot ____ ?"</p><p>&nbsp; - um, well - it doesn't exactly say that anywhere. It's inferred perhaps a little over here in the bit about Authority Over Domains - and if you'd attended either of the trainings you'd have seen a slide that says policies&nbsp;can't require action and heard lots of discussion that said they can't - but it's not explicit in the constitution. Oh - and of course if you were on the CoP you'd see all the smart people agreeing that it's invalid governance."</p><p>Examples of what I'm talking about? &nbsp;Sure, look at how screwed up we are - why not? Somebody made a decision at some point to turn our Glassfrog account public so have a look - I have a nearly endless supply of shame available&nbsp;so why not? Many of the policies at our anchor circle concern me but have a look specifically at&nbsp;these four:</p><p><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/642608" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/642608</a> &nbsp;'will provide'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7802" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7802</a> 'wil contact', '[will] enter their absence'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/7608343</a> 'shall each have' which is understood as 'will provide/is required to provide'<br /><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/6856" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/6856</a> 'will each communicate daily'</p><p>All of those items occurred post-adoption or I'd say they could be bundled as legacy policy. &nbsp;Brian suggested @ coach training to work them into a work/employment agreement, have all concerned sign, then strike the governance. &nbsp;That is the tentative plan - but in addition to anchor facilitator trying to audit governance I hope to also coach - and would like more WHY.</p><p>That's why I'm looking for more from the constitution on Policy.</p><p>and yes - maybe I'm intimidated by shadow power structure and trying to socialize a WHY prior to just being a Ferrari and acting on tension</p><p>and, I'm human.</p></dd>
