  <dd><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>I'd like to change the <strong>Testing Objection card</strong> in clear sentences. F.e. 1) The proposal would degrade the Circle's capacity (this is explanation), then the green part Is THAT a reason this causes harm or moves us backward? (and how?) The word THAT is confusing when you read it for the first time. Is it the proposal or the objection?&nbsp;I would like to change&nbsp;it into&nbsp;"Is this proposal a reason this causes harm or moves the circle backward? ("and how?). Then in blue "Is IT a better idea...". I would like to change this in "Is your proposal a better idea or...?" So on for the whole card.</p><p>At&nbsp;the <strong>Governance Meetings card</strong> I would like to see an add. Because "tension" in Dutch feels very big, heavily and blocks people. I always ask for positive tensions / ideas&nbsp;or negative tensions / something that bothers you or you want to get rid off. Maybe the word can be softened somehow? In the closing round I would like to explain the reflection by adding&nbsp;"thoughts or&nbsp;feelings,&nbsp;&nbsp;you want to leave behind in this meeting, so you it becomes knowledge for the whole group and we can improve next meetings."</p><p>At the <strong>Tactical Meetings card</strong> I'd like to add that it is a fast pace meeting and a short explanation why we review the checklist, metrics and project updates. But maybe this is too much explanations for the cards and people just need to read the book and/or attend a training &nbsp;;-).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
