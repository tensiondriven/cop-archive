  <dd><p>PS: You write: "We are starting to implement holacracy. And we have the initial structure setup. I understand that based on the getting started guide, the next step would be to hold our first governance meeting." If you are very new to Holacracy it might make sense to look for a seasoned Holacracy veteran who supports you with the big change that you are trying to bring to the company. Moving from a conventional structure to Holacracy is a big leap and from the little information I have, it sounds to me like it would make sense to set up a proper change management process. E.g. educate and train the people of your organization on what is happening, why it is happening and what they can influence and expect for the future. Maybe you have all this in place, but I just wanted to point out, that it is a big endeavour that you are undertaking and I recommend that you get some help or at least partake in one of the Practitioner trainings if you haven't already.</p><p>I'm not putting in an application, just trying to give some peer support from first hand experience <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
