  <dd><p>I think the problem with words is that they mean something else for everyone, and this gets worse if you are from&nbsp;different backgrounds or languages.</p><p>Therefore, I think you should keep with the default vocabulary as much as possible. That way it becomes something you actually don't care about, it's not about those words / names, but about the new way of working.</p><p>If you focus on getting the wording "right" you're focussing on the wrong things: mostly, fitting Holacracy into other people's existing ideas about it instead of a shared new thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this makes sense, somewhat paradoxically maybe <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
