  <dd><p>Good questions and answers. I'd add one more: is there a real, live, compelling reason (qualifying tension) that would be addressed by collapsing the sub-circle into the broader circle?</p><p>It's not just objections that are tested, but proposals. Any proposal that comes about could be asked to describe the tension and give a live example of a situation that could have been prevented if the circles were joined.</p></dd>
