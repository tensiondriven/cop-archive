  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Fred Magovern posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>There are a whole bunch of other roles filled by other partners.

Especially IF the tensions that created them in the first place are still there and the accountabilities of the subcircle stay untouched? (unless that was the initial setup of the circle as designed during adoption)</p></dd>
