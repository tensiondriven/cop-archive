  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Flavio Souza Ratzke posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>By default, the Lead Link role has the authority to assign partners for the roles. So, if the Lead Link assigned someone, the Partner&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;the duty to process the Role, whether the Partner liked the Role or not. It´s his job. The Lead Link has the freedom to assign and unassign roles anytime, so you can choose to put a Partner rotation on this Role.</p></div></blockquote><p>Sure, but the constitution also states ("2.4.3 Resignation from Roles") : "When you fill a Role, you may resign from the Role at any time, unless you’ve agreed otherwise, by giving notice to whoever controls assignments to that Role – typically, the Circle’s Lead Link."</p><p>Yes, the LL can assign someone to a role, but since the role filler can resign anytime, this can lead to an "infinite&nbsp;loop" of assignment/resignation. Isn't that conflicting ?</p></dd>
