  <dd><p><strong>What info do you put in the market place? Is it only the role, or the role with competences like minimum scrum master degree, or ... years experience in...?</strong></p><p>The answer may vary from one client to another - minimum would be the role and the level of interest, then you could add some kinda competencies (some of our clients use Badges for competences needed by the Organization). So the explicit heuristic used by a LL for assigning would be something like - assigning the partners having the greatest desire to fill the role and having the appropriate competences. You may also define priorities within the different criteria...</p></dd>
