  <dd><p>Eric: &nbsp;I actually wouldn't even say "you sense that the tension may be caused by unclear accountability or authority", because people rarely "sense" that - that's a logical conclusion, not a sensing. &nbsp;And even the mental model that it is "caused by" unclear accountability/authority becomes&nbsp;limiting, because often the tension isn't "caused by" anything in particular, it's just a current state of the system, with&nbsp;many systemic influences leading to it. &nbsp;There's no need to collapse down to a single cause, or even to try to logically conclude what "caused" it. &nbsp;The more useful question is just&nbsp;how (to what extent and in what way)&nbsp;governance will resolve it, vs. how it can be resolved operationally. &nbsp;You can resolve most tensions to some degree via both methods, so it's not an either/or, but a relative weighing of the most effective channel(s) to use to resolve the tension.</p></dd>
