  <dd><p>I have been struggling with this the last months. At the beginning of the Holacracy implementation we had great coaches, which made time-outs or explained the right way to formulate an objection at the end of the meetings, in case you made a mistake. Since they are gone, our facilitators make a great job, but they just stick strictly to the rules, and this has had some negative effects on the participation rate in the meetings and the trust/sympathy towards the system. Of course this has a big connection to our organizational culture. Not everybody had the same chance to make the practitioner training, and we are not really a great example for a Trust and psychological security- characterized Environment, so many people are really afraid of fail, and don’t want to expose their selves. People which made the experience, that the way of formulating their tensions was not valid, just started missing the meetings or stopped raising tensions to avoid “blame”. I have observed this scene in almost every circle I shadow. People have really VALID reasons but answer to the check-questions in a wrong way, so then they are just out of the game. It certainly hearts them to hear “you just told me, that your tension is invalid” and to see the process goes just forwards, without caring about this still unsolved but justified tension. If every facilitator had a coaching or pedagogical background, they wouldn’t probably need any other formula. They would recognize and differentiate between not valid reasons and not valid “expressions/answer” to explain that reason. As this is (at least for us) mostly not the case, I guess some “tip” regarding not valid objections with valid Reasons might be helpful (Of course I did tell them, this is not an encouraging situation from a psychological perspective, but as it is not embedded into the system, they don’t feel like they could/should do something about it).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I think it is very important to hold the process and the rules, &nbsp;but at least as important is to aknowledge the learning process people are going through and to take into account, which impact our expressions and behaviours may have on the development of the change-story. If we keep refusing valid objections, just because they are not expressed as they should, we might be inhibiting the development of positive behaviours, more than stopping the negative ones.&nbsp;</p></dd>
