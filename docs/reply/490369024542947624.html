  <dd><p>Paul,</p><p>In addition to sharing the Governance that was enacted to support the experiment, I would be interested in hearing how the Holacracy Circle is represented in the broader Circle. &nbsp;To Karilen's point, the LL is the catch-all for any and all work that has yet to be defined in a role within the Circle.</p><p>Also, if you set up a call with Karilen&nbsp;and the Hola coaches, I'd love to join in the discussion.</p><p>Thanks for sharing,</p><p>- Dennis</p></dd>
