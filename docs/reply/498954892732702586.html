  <dd><p>Martin,</p><p>If you have just 1 person, you should&nbsp;collapse the circle back as a role. Usually you create a circle when you have more than 1 person and want to give them more freedom in terms of self-organization. Otherwise a role is just fine.</p><p>About the "former" manager: there are many different possible paths. He or she&nbsp;can go back to the trenches&nbsp;by energizing roles that perform&nbsp;"operational work" that he used to manage. Another possibility is filling roles related to coaching and training. In some circles it is common to have a role that centralizes some kind of process or strategy, where other roles are accountable for aligning with. For example, in some software development circles&nbsp;there might be&nbsp;a role accountable for defining and improving a software development process (In this case, it is important to make other roles accountable for following the process defined). I think that might be an appropriate role for a "former" manager.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p></dd>
