  <dd><p>[@mention:449833773917801859], if the need for hiring/firing has not been encoded in a Role, doesn't that undifferentiated responsibility remain with the circle lead link? It sounds to me like&nbsp;[@mention:500362325511060252]&nbsp;is dealing with a rather new company if it does not yet have roles for hiring/firing. It may even be that the GCC is still the only circle (i.e., an existing organization either does not it barely exists). I agree that the best solution is to craft those roles through governance soon.</p></dd>
