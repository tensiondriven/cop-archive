  <dd><p>D.&nbsp; Do not object, because this kind of objection is&nbsp;usually not valid for good reason, and then actually fill the role yourself until you have a better option.&nbsp; There is no such thing as "not being able" to fill the role;&nbsp;you can fill a role with near zero time going into it, because filling a role only requires consciously defining and prioritizing work, not necessarily doing work.</p></dd>
