  <dd><p>Hi Gerald,</p><p>We were advised early in our Holacracy practice to shy away from cross links&nbsp;for fear that they may pop up all over the organization. &nbsp;Additionally, &nbsp;the analogy used was that of allowing your neighbor to come into your house and rearrange&nbsp;your furniture (which did not seem like a great idea a the time!)</p><p>The advisor roles that have found their way into our&nbsp;Governance all have similar purposes, that relate to improved communications between Circles, hence the term advisor.</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Dennis</p></dd>
