  <dd><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>I struggle more with the NVGO objection you are raising, since this is a very hard judgement and especially for beginner groups and people who are not best at phrasing things this is very challenging. I have made the experience that too rigid coaching adds complexity and raises the bar so that people feel frustrated and step back from processing anything at all . Which is the worst thing that can happen IMO.</p><p>So I might actually leave it like that and let the process do its job. If it is not clear enough it will show up down the road after a while. However it's phrased it creates some clarity not there before and is thus a minimum viable next step for me.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerald</p></dd>
