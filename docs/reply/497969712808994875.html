  <dd><p>Hi Koen,</p><p>I implemented Holacracy in a&nbsp; consultancy company founded by 4 theater actors.</p><p>Acually, they'd rather quickly play the game and got into the process, as they realize it is efficient and clarifying.</p><p>Ma perspective is that it coulb be easier to practice with creative people instead of technical ones... who could try to challenge the process at any step.</p><p>Hope that helps,</p><p>Jean-Michel</p></dd>
