  <dd><p>Yes Margaux, I fully agree. If co-working could mean cost reduction for big company set up in very expensive cities, it could&nbsp;be the opposite for smaller one I guess.</p><p>Maybe some "discount" co-working places exist in your area ? By discount I mean not much more than Starbuck, without Starbuck heavy traffic :-) There are some around start-up incubators usually : Chairs, tables, coffee and wi-fi :-)</p><p>Or maybe some associations in your area where you could get connected to some entrepreneurs like you who are looking for places from time to time to gather, exchange, and work ?</p><p>Just brainstorming here.</p></dd>
