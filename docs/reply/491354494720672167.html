  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>I offer the following:</p><p>Point 1) - Generally speaking, and this may vary depending &nbsp;how far along the circle is on their journey, you want to stay neutral and follow the process steps.... checkin - get present, call out distractions, etc &nbsp;- get through administrative concerns and guide the team to build their agenda. &nbsp;For a new circle, you may want to spend some time explaining the purpose of&nbsp;Governance, but generally speaking, i prefer to jump right in to&nbsp;Governance.</p><p>Point 2) - No... let them ramble on... then model best behaviors during your checkin. &nbsp;They will figure it out over time and will likely fall into the normal meeting cadance. &nbsp;</p><p>Point 3) - Gerald summed this up nicely. &nbsp;I prefer to give the tension-holder plenty of room to share their tension trust the process to sort out proposals that may no be rooted in a tension.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p>Dennis</p></dd>
