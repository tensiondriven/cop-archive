  <dd><p>This authority is assigned by default to the lead-links of all companies circles. From this point of view, we need to take from them this authority and allocate it to a separate domain. The question is, can we do this? Can the main circle limit the authority of the of other circles by making a governance decision in the main circle?</p><p><br />This is just one example of such decisions. For example, we also want to&nbsp;adopt a badge system in the company. Is it enough that we will make such a decision at the meeting of the main circle? Will the decision made in the main circle be binding for all circles and roles in the company (speech about the circles and roles of the third, fourth, etc. level)? Is it enough that we simply announce to the circles about the decision?</p></dd>
