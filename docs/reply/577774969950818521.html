  <dd><blockquote><p>If Partner A ignored Governance to take actions outside of established procedure (legacy policy) and make decisions in an area of authority clearly delineated as a domain of Partner B's role, what is there to do?</p></blockquote><p>Some questions first to help answer your question:&nbsp; Did Partner A do so willfully (knowing they were violating a rule), or&nbsp;ignorantly (unaware of it)?&nbsp; If the former, does it fall within the rules of Individual Action, or outside of them (and why)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Partner A agree with your interpretation of those answers?&nbsp; Does Partner B feel any tension about Partner A's action?</p><p>There are completely different pathways that make sense to engage here depending on the answers to those questions...</p></dd>
