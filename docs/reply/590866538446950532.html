  <dd><p>[@mention:590444325765688151], i don't understand what u mean by mixing two kinds of meetings, is it going to be one after the other or do a tactical meeting with governance meeting process or vice versa, and if u think of mixing the two processes it can be a disaster for your organisation. Both meetings have a different purpose and so different forms. if you have a rush to do things and scarcity of time, then as its the norm the stuff which needs to come in the tactical meeting can come between people without the meeting on a one to one conversation or just call an offline conversation. Besides, i am wonderign if you have done any practitioner training as in that they explain the purpose of both the meetings very clearly.&nbsp;</p></dd>
