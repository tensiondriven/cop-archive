  <dd><p>Hi Jennie, as we are focused on the Tension holder and solve one Tension at a time, the answer is Yes. When the Tension holder says "I got what I need" then the agenda item is closed. Off course like Erik states, the other Partner can always add an Agenda item.</p><p>Although the Partner may have input the question remains if this needed information for the Tension holder. That is also why one of the Pathways is Request Information/Help. When this one is named by the Tension holder that is the invite to other Partners to share their idea's or opinion.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p></dd>
