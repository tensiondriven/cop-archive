  <dd><p>Do you have any concrete questions (i.e. "How do you do X or Y")? My personal experience: I keep both my board &nbsp;and advisory board&nbsp;largely out of Holacracy. They like it, but care less about how we organise than how successful we are.&nbsp;</p><p>The board sets our GCC strategy (in our case in the form of OKRs), but since I'm both the majority shareholder and GCC LL, this isn't as official in practice as it sounds <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I have introduced some of the Tactical meeting processes for our board meetings though, and I regularly point advisors to roles within my organisation, and invite them for Q&amp;A's where we do discuss Holacracy sometimes.</p></dd>
