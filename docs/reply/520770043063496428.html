That means that both objector and proposer will have to amend the initial proposal until it becomes "safe enough to try", even without known data.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br /> Jean-Michel</p></div></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Thanks but I think I understand the concept. My intention is to make the card easier to understand. The way it is right now, gives the idea that if&nbsp;there is a reason we can’t adapt once we get more data, then the objection is not valid. Please check the card if I'm misunderstanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cheers,&nbsp;</p></dd>
