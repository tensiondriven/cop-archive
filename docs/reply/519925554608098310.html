  <dd><p>@Karilen, somewhere I. The leadership literature from the past 25 years is a story re. a cleaning lady who scolded the company president for walking past an easy to address mess. The president was not offended since the corporate culture held that anyone and everyone held responsibility for the image and safety of the organization. Thus, "taking out the trash" did not need to be assigned to any single person since everyone naturally held that accountability. Is this along the lines of what you're sensing?</p></dd>
