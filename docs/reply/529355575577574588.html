  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:528792613988609658]!</p><p>Personally, I'm a fan of Holacracy, Pandemic, and D&amp;D, so that sounds cool to me! I think with a longer simulation, you can work in operational "work" of sorts so that tensions can arise - in the 5-day training, the simulation spans 2 or 3 days or something like that, so you probably have more opportunity in a longer game, or I would think it would work in a shorter game if you can give them things to do along with obstacles to that.</p></dd>
