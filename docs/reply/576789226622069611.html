<p>On this issue, <strong>"Testing the same objection by different people."</strong> For something like adding a domain of website, there are likely many roles which may object based on what they need. But those would be different objections&nbsp;and therefore would need to be tested independently.</p><p>For example,&nbsp;a role that's accountable for "Publishing new blog posts on the website," (likely valid objection) has a different argument than another role with an accountability for, "Marketing events" (likely invalid objection because "Marketing events," doesn't necessarily determine that this role would need unimpeded access to the website without having to ask for permission).&nbsp;</p><p>If it was actually the&nbsp;same objection, it would be something like, "this proposal limits the&nbsp;Blogger role's ability to publish blogs." But Anyone not in the Blogger role wouldnt&nbsp;be able to pass criteria #4 of course. Just one quick thought.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
