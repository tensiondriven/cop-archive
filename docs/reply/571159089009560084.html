  <dd><p>I'm not the OP, but&nbsp;when I read their comment, I assumed that during governance an accountability was added. See&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md#143-amending-elected-roles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="1.4.3 Amending Elected Roles">1.4.3 Amending Elected Roles</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A Circle may add Accountabilities or Domains to its own Elected Roles, as well as amend or remove those additions. However, no Circle may amend or remove any Purpose, Domain, Accountabilities, or authorities granted to an Elected Role by this Constitution, nor remove an Elected Role entirely.</p></blockquote></dd>
