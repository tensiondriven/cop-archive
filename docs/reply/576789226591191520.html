  <dd><p>As I often say in my trainings,&nbsp;you can have the perfect&nbsp;role structure and the perfect constitutional rule set adopted, but if you assign six year olds to fill all&nbsp;your roles and govern the organization using those rules, you're going to have a disaster, not a high-functioning organization.&nbsp; Sounds like you might have some adults acting like six year olds there - even if&nbsp;for lots of understandable reasons.&nbsp; Every company does of course (most of us act like six year olds at least sometimes), though I do think you need a certain ratio or critical mass of adults-acting-like-adults vs. those acting like six year olds to avoid that becoming a huge bottleneck.&nbsp; I'd be curious how a conventional management hierarchy would deal with that situation too though, and if it'd&nbsp;enable any more high functioning than&nbsp;Holacracy would (perhaps it would, or perhaps not, and likely it'd be a big bottleneck either way).&nbsp; All that to say: you probably have an issue there regardless of your organizational framework, and Holacracy is not designed to solve that issue any more than management hierarchy is; whichever framework you use, you probably need other tools on top of it to address those issues...&nbsp; And I know that's not very helpful; if I had a tool to offer you I'd share it, but as a business leader in both management hierarchy and Holacracy, my solution to the issue of adults routinely acting like six year olds has been fairly crude and simplistic (although effective): fire them quickly and&nbsp;find someone else to do the work instead.&nbsp; :-)</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
