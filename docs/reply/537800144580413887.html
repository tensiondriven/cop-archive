  <dd><p>Agree that it is a good idea to have a role that manages hiring strategy and plan. &nbsp;</p><p>In practice, that role is easy to create. &nbsp;The harder question to consider "who has the final decision on hiring". &nbsp;Is it the hiring strategy role, a central Recruitment Decision Maker role, or the LL of each circle? &nbsp;Your choice depending on your company size and culture.</p></dd>
