<p>Hi Andrew - Are those reasonably long-term teams (vs. ones that will disband in a few months), and will each face different circumstances and contexts, such that each may want to adapt to its environment slightly differently? &nbsp;If yes to both, then you may still want to have one circle per team, even if they start with very similar or identical role descriptions, so that they can then further adapt via governance from there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are other ways to structure this as well - this isn't necessarily the best option, but thought I'd suggest that it is one option, and I think often a good one. &nbsp;Consider asking a coach real-time during one of the coach office hours sessions for more options and suggestions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
