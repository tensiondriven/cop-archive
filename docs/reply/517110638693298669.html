  <dd><p>Thanks Joe. You're right, the cards are not exactly the same as the Constitution&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art423" target="_blank">Section 4.2.3 (d)</a>&nbsp;. We've made the same *mistake* with the french localization of the cards. I was exploring the option of amending it, and was at first looking for an example/situation where Circle Members would give updates re an Accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>Could you tell me more re this case you've have had when "someone was recapping one of their accountabilities" - curious to know more about it.</p></dd>
