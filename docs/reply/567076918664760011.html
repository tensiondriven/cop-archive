  <dd><p>Ray, AWO,</p><p>If you&nbsp;do not respect the black boxes as explained by Margaux, and have a LOT of cross accountabilities, might be worth at some point to step back and ask yourself if the "membrane" is at the right place. In other words, why role having strong interactions are not part of the same circle ?</p><p>Again, don't bother if it's only here and there. But to me it's getting questionable when it's becoming a rule.</p></dd>
