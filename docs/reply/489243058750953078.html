  <dd><p>Dien lays of the options as I think of it as well. The only clarity I would add is you could do this one of two ways: 1) specify a domain as Dien describes or 2) create an accountability for mobile developer as Dien described in his last sentence.</p><p>Personally, I try to avoid domains where I can because they are such a heavy tool (use accountabilities instead) and they can be abused to make things feel too much like command-and-control. However, domains may be necessary and can be an efficient way to convey needs to more of the organization.</p><p>If it makes sense, you may start with some linked accountabilities and see if that resolves the tension.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
