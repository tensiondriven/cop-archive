<p>Hi Alexia &amp; Margaux, thank you very much for your ideas!</p><p>@alexia: well, your answer made me think about, if the tactical meeting is the right for(u)m to share information. Maybe we should use the tactical meeting more for collecting views and to solve tensions (which are not governance issues).</p><p>@margaux: in the sales circle we have people who are only rarely inhouse and at the moment we have vacation time. So, there are reasons why people do not attend our meetings, which we have to accept. Your idea (from a costumer) to use "trigger" for documenting/sharing information of a tactical meeting is very helpful for us. I will also promote the function "notes" for some kind of information.</p><p>I think we will feel in future more comfortable with the tactical meetings. Thanks a lot for your support.</p>  </div>
