  <dd><p>One formal note: You are making requests to the Secretary, while it would be the <em>Facilitator's</em> job to capture Agenda items. (See 3.3.4 - Agenda Building).</p><p>The process for Agenda Building is clear:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When adding an agenda item, a participant may only provide a short label for the Tension, and may not explain or discuss the Tension further</p></blockquote><p>It seems to me that you need to urge the Facilitator to follow the rules and <em>build an agenda</em> properly.&nbsp;</p><p>The constitution doesn't specify an exact format for this agenda (or the process how it should be built), but you could easily propose one as a Policy, I think.</p><p>On another note: If agenda items are not captured fully at the beginning, usually there is little harm, because the tension persists and the tension holder can always add an agenda item later.</p><p>Does this help?</p></dd>
