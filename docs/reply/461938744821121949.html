  <dd><p>Hi Frederik,</p><p>I would like to collaborate with the Spanish version. I can also speak Catalan but not sufficiently well enough to help. I have just taken on a new project which will limit the amount of time I can give it, but I can commit to proof reading and general review. I have previously worked as a translator so hopefully this should be of some help.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Paul</p></dd>
