  <dd><p>Hi Sam</p><p>Some&nbsp;question regarding the first bucket</p><p>Did anyone define what level of adoption should be targeted (maybe from the ratifiers)? Is there any budget allocated for improvements? Should people (employees?) care about that level? Did they sign something were they declare to pursuit holacracy and its goals? Are there incentives to invest time into a good holacracy practice?</p><p>(Those questions surfaced in our company after a couple of months living with holacracy)</p></dd>
