  <dd><p>Okay, so my pitch is a bit of a word-smith item - re the standardized use of "What do you need?"</p><p>In my organization we endeavor to differentiate from WANT and NEED - and the standard use of addressing/processing Tensions are about WANT. &nbsp;</p><p>I am using and promoting the use of "What do you want to have happen?" in our Holacracy Study. &nbsp;It's a simple substitution and reinforces the separate between OPINION and FACT.</p><p>Then, the follow-up, instead of "Did you get what you need?", we're testing out 'Is this handled for now?' and 'Does that address your Tension?'</p><p>Again, the idea is not to FULLY RESOLVE every Tension in the course of the meeting, but to provide the individual the <strong>means</strong> to get the Tension resolved. &nbsp;So the Facilitator's job is to just check to see if the means to get resolve has been met - and certainly not to fulfill someone's arbitrarily-defined sense of NEED.</p><p>We use the meeting cards heavily and other than that language item - found in the Tactical Meeting card's Triage section and Facilitator Tips. &nbsp;I don't believe it's on the Governance card.</p></dd>
