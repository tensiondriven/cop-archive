  <dd><p>Hi Dien,&nbsp;</p><p>That breaks it down nicely. I think it is mostly #1 and #2. I don't think it is as much about using tactical meetings to disseminate information per se. I've done that in tactical meetings. I just make sure to keep the topic for the next meeting or send out the information separately if there is someone who isn't at the meeting that needs to know. I think it is more about using the meeting minutes/notifications as your tool for conveying that information or decisions, and expecting that to be "official" somehow.</p><p>An extreme example I can think of is saying something like "We all need to come in at 10am on Saturday" and sending it out as an "information piece" in a tactical meeting, and then having an expectation that everyone will do that because it was in the tactical meeting minutes, and send out via the email.&nbsp;</p><p>But, to your point in #3, I think it is always good to think about which roles need information, and to prevent using tactical meetings as a way to get consensus.&nbsp;</p></dd>
