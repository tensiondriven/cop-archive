  <dd><p>Thank you all for the replies. I am indeed referring to article&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution40#art433" target="_blank">4.3.3</a>. which states this.</p><p>Quoting&nbsp;[@mention:449411339497350002]&nbsp;on this:</p><p>"&nbsp;Reporting on accountabilities progress was introduced in the constitution 4.1, but GlassFrog has not incorporated this change directly yet. However, I would suggest to simply capture the "accountability progress" as a project in GlassFrog for accountabilities you want regular updates on. Yes GlassFrog will treat it as a project, but as long as you're clear it's not, it works fine. Maybe capture&nbsp;the "project" name by "Accountability: ____________" so everyone is clear on what it is. " (<a href="/topic/progress-updates-on-accountabilities" target="_blank"><a href="...-on-accountabilities" target="_blank">...-on-accountabilities</a></a>)</p><p>Interesting to see the different practices, and also surprised&nbsp;nobody in this thread&nbsp;has developed governance (a policy) around&nbsp;it, since the constitution here does allow for more specificity. But probably no tensions around this.</p></dd>
