  <dd><p>Hi Dennis,</p><p>I can see the argument for it being a Worker characteristic, however, I wonder if there's a counter argument relating to the difference between a company's market capitalisation and the book value of its tangible assets - the intangible value.</p><p>The Intellectual Capital framework gives a sound explanation for the gap - people capital, relationship capital and structural capital in some combination.</p><p>All this points to the importance of individual and organisational learning by doing/experimentation, and capturing and deploying that learning/experimentation.</p><p>I assume that an organisation that's adopted Holacracy has a better chance of releasing and encouraging the creative capacity of the people that work in it than other systems of governance.</p><p>Maybe when you expand on "dynamic", it's something in this direction that you have in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Andrew</p></dd>
