  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:567076918898373343]&nbsp; - the constitution specifically allows for offline (or "asynchronous") governance.&nbsp;The policy we use at GrantTree for is pasted below.

So you can give and request project updates at any time. There are also a number of tools for facilitating team stands (for instance the Howdy plug-in app for Slack - <a href="https://howdy.ai" target="_blank"><a href="https://howdy.ai" target="_blank">https://howdy.ai</a></a>) that can be set to ask people to report on their metrics and checklists at set inetrvals.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>Best wishes, Andrew&nbsp;</p><p>-------</p><ul><li class="box" id="policy_9480807"><div class="box__header"><h4 class="header--small">Policy: <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/9480807">Asynchronous Proposals</a></h4></div><div class="box__body"><p>All circles support asynchronous proposals.
