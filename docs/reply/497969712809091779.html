  <dd><p>Jean-Michel,</p><p>thank you so much for your perspective. I like your suggestion and I think it is a great way to move forward. It gives the former department leaders some time to get adjusted and it avoids overwhelming them by losing their sense of position.</p><p>Your response is very supportive. I am also curious if anyone else has some insights or experience re the transitiion for people who were leading and representing their departments and now take on the LL role and pass on their representing status.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Martin</p></dd>
