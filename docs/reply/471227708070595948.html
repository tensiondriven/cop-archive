  <dd><p>Frederik,</p><p>I would say one aspect of Holacracy is that it allows you to separate out organizational fit and termination from just role fit / performance per se.</p><p>A few practices/principles:</p><ul><li>No one person fires</li><li>Clear pathways for assessing a fit for the organization that may or may not result in an exiting from the organization</li><li>Lead Links are not the only input into a termination decision</li><li>Process is transparent</li></ul><p>Step 1: define a role to create the process as a starting point. Then try prototyping something when you have a tension would be my advice. You may need "termination or employment reviewer roles" etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are my thoughts. Would love to see how this shapes up for you all. Please keep sharing!</p><p>Karilen&nbsp;</p></dd>
