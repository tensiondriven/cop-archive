  <dd><p>Hi Marco,</p><p>We've got a feature request in the backlog to allow choosing a role for a tension in both tactical meetings and from the My Tensions list. The reason it doesn't allow it now is just that we had wanted to ship it sooner in GlassFrog and felt that we could deliver it without the option to choose a role.&nbsp;Personally, I like to use this format for describing my tension:&nbsp;"As &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal/desire&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;." See <a href="/topic/idea-for-tension-description-format-from-agile-software-development" target="_blank">this post</a> for more info on that.</p></dd>
