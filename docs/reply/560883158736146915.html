  <dd><p>Ewa Bocian, the Holacracy coach you guys recommended to me, asked me about my impressions of being on the Holacracy forum. I said I felt like an ant watching an elephant's trunk swinging above it in a friendly and caring way. In an hour long phone talk Ewa put me on the right track. I got my answer to the question I asked the Holacracy community. Thank you so much. Special thanks to Ewa and Matt in particular.</p></dd>
