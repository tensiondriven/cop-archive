<p>[@mention:550889693769022824]&nbsp;-- Given this, "<em>This is a policy about compensation and we are opening the policy to be&nbsp;edited by folks&nbsp;that would be compensated in that policy where the parameters of what or how we can compensate people is unclear (hence the disagreement)</em>," the problem is that the objections don't meet criteria&nbsp;#3, i.e. it's a tension felt in one of the roles you fill. Seems like it's a tension felt by <strong>the person</strong> filling the role, rather than the <strong>role itself</strong>. I wrote about this difference in my article, "T<a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/this-time-its-personal-592102943e52" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his Time It's Personal</a>." Basically, even though one's performance in their role may be impacted by a compensation concern, it's still a tension felt by the person (and not the role), because the formal expectations of the role "Trainer" haven't changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, those objections aren't valid as a part of the governance integration process, however of course, they may be valid tensions to process. My recommendation is instead of proposing the policy, create a role like "Compensation Captain," and give it a&nbsp;domain like "Compensation for Trainers" and an accountability like "Designing and&nbsp;enacting a fair compensation process for Trainers." That way there is one clear decision-maker, who can then assume will energize that role to the best of their judgment (but likely to include data gathering from the impacted Trainers).</p><p>And I would highly, highly discourage this, "<em>I think we will revisit this in an extraordinary governance meeting as you suggest and <strong>will encourage the next proposer to come with a solid proposal ahead of time for people to respond to."</strong></em> As reasonable as that seems, it actually makes things worse and creates what I call the "objection death spiral." Objections shouldn't be avoided. They aren't the problem. And a "bad" proposal that prompts objections isn't the problem either. The problem,&nbsp;in this case, is that you're trying to integrate lots of <strong>invalid objections</strong>.&nbsp;Remove them and use the process as normal.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
