  <dd><p>Hi Anja,</p><p>i have done a lot of lean process implementation as a consultant. And just like you and&nbsp;[@mention:452086181438015612]Describe it is all focused around a professor instead of around people doing the work in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A good way to integrated the process thinking in Holacracy is to admention other roles in accountabilities. E.g. "Packaging our product after @production and handing it over to&nbsp;@logistics". You get in this way very explicit how the handovers work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly make the process/competence/trainer roles you have explicit. Whatever you currently have to boost process quality. Although don't take away ownership of quality from the peephole actually doing the process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Koen</p></dd>
