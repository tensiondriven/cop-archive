  <dd><p>Hi Pieter,</p><p>From my perspective, Domains are a powerful tool. But setting more and more Domains decrease flexibility. It's why I'd only create domains when unconstrained access does damage the organization.</p><p>Moreover, setting Domains is not the only way to give more clarity to the organization. Another way could be defining more precisely authorities and accountabilities of the roles involved in the tension behind.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
