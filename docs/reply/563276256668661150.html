  <dd><p>I do not think it is about feeling as friends/brothers/sisters. It is more about not living in&nbsp;"fear/worries". If people do not feel defensive against each others and do not feel threatened, using positive assumption more than suspicion (example of trusted environment), organizational change will be smoother. If trust is there, there will be less friction and resistance. IMO <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
