  <dd><p>Hi Fajar: I agree with everything Margaux says, and want to underscore that it is not easy...though it can be easier to have success on a small team instead of at a larger scale. You can sign up for GlassFrog Premium and use the habit program content to help you in addition to training.</p><p><a href="https://glassfrog.com/" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.com/</a></p><p>I think a team of 3 is the smallest size that is practical so I would be curious to see how it goes with your team of 4. &nbsp;<img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />&nbsp;</p><p>Before the first governance, try to keep the preparation simple for the structuring. Craft one role with a purpose or an accountability, and try to time box it to an hour or so. You don't need to spend too much time because you will use the governance process to evolve the roles and add roles over time. Often teams spend more time than is needed trying to design the the perfect structure or over engineer their initial structure.</p><p>Alternatively you could also start out as circle members and propose the roles, but it is messier, especially without anyone who has been trained.&nbsp;Try to get some coaching if you can at the beginning. There are some facilitators on the community here who may be looking for practice opportunities.</p><p>Also, if you don't have a coach it will be more difficult. Either way, use the meeting reference cards as a guide on how to practice the meeting processes.</p><p>Governance:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/governance-meetings</a></p><p>Tactical:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings" target="_blank">http://www.holacracy.org/tactical-meetings</a></p><p>Expect to take six months on average to get the mechanics down, so try to set a reasonable time frame before you decide if it works or not.</p><p>Keep us posted on how it is going!</p></dd>
