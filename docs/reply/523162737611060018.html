  <dd><p>Hi Flavio, Keith:</p><p>I have a different understanding. &nbsp;A circle level domain is a communal property and can be impacted by all Circle Members without permission from the Lead Link of that Circle.</p><p>Roles from other Circles wanting to impact the domain of a certain circle, however, must ask someone, a person, for permission, and that person is the Lead Link of that circle, not any other members of that circle.</p><p>Perhaps someone else can clarify this ?</p><p>Dien.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
