  <dd><p>Hey Andrew,&nbsp;</p><p>interesting one. I like it.&nbsp;</p><p>I would ascribe the drive for Mastery as a quality to the Worker in the New World of Work - the "Purpose Agent".&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, when trying to come up with a characterization of the Purpose Agent (which is still work in progress) this came up high on my list, too. I'll bookmark that book, thanks!</p><p>Do you see mastery a trait of the new world of work <em>itself,&nbsp;</em>or of the <em>worker</em> in the new world of work? I tend towards the latter.&nbsp;</p><p>best,&nbsp;</p><p>Dennis&nbsp;</p></dd>
