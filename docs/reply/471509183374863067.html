  <dd><p>Hi Tony,</p><p>Like Margaux said, GlassFrog is pretty rudimentary for actions and triggers, and actually projects as well. As GlassFrog Product Manager, I've taken a note of your request for further processing.</p><p>I'm thinking that access to better personal syncing support will be first available via the api, and then the plan is to work on third-party integrations (like Asana) and see where that gets us. My current thinking is that I'd like GlassFrog to be basically functional if you have nothing, but there are so many tools out there that specialize in personal systems and are so good at it, that syncing with them seems like the first step. I know I would find it incredibly helpful.</p><p>The only other place I can think of to get lists of the outputs in the GlassFrog UI is from the meeting history itself.</p></dd>
