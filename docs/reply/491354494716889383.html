  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>find my thoughts and experiences below.</p><p>ad 1) I do use some time to frame the session right at the very beginning even before entering into check-in. for early-practice circles that seems&nbsp;very helpful in my impression. for me it is also&nbsp;about building a connection and&nbsp;helping people to feel in a "safe container".&nbsp;</p><p>ad 2) No</p><p>ad 3) all of the stated questions might help. However, one concern or recommendation: make sure you don't trigger a "justification energy" right at the beginning. the most helpful attitude for a facilitator is a neutral stance trusting the process. for me it is not best practice&nbsp;as facilitator to validate a tension/proposal&nbsp;and let the person prove that this is a valid even before entering into the process. That's rather called "heroic facilitation" which is a trap in the beginning in my experience ;-). You might ask some questions like you proposed,&nbsp;if a circle member requests that. But just as standard pattern it creates a weird judgemental setting. Instead, use and trust the process to do its job. Use clarifying questions and reaction round (in-process-coaching) to help the person find out, what it is about...</p><p>hope that helps.</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
