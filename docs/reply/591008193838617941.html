  <dd><p>Surely, the answer to this depends on which role is sensing the tension to move the role from sub circle to sub circle? If the Lead Link of the super circle senses the tension, I can see how this can be done in one governance meeting (two proposals). However, let's say that the role itself senses the tension to be moved, the proposal would need to be brought to the super circle by the Rep Link. In which case, would it be relevant for the Rep Link to then propose the second part of the move to the other sub circle (that they are not rep link of)? If the role itself, senses the tension to be in the other sub circle, my thinking is that their best pathway is to ask the Lead Link of the other sub circle to bring a proposal to create their role and then delete their role from the existing sub circle. Thoughts?</p></dd>
