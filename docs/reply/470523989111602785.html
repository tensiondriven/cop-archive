  <dd><p>my take (experts please jump in and correct me if needed) :</p><p>Constitution deals with the matter in a few spots (disclaimer : i am not using the complete wording)</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;3.1 : this article Does not list &nbsp;resource and partner allocation as valid governance</p><p>- &nbsp;Appendix A: Lead link assigns partners and resources</p><p>- &nbsp;2.2.3 : Lead link Accountabilities&nbsp;can be delegated to other roles or alternate means.</p><p>My conclusion is that you can delegate partner assignment to any separated process you may choose, but this has nothing to do with the governance meeting.</p><p>On a general basis it is my understanding that a separation of resource assignment from governance is the key to avoid proposals and objections to become polluted by resource availability issues. This is a very good thing to do because many ideas would otherwise be stopped by sentences such as "we don't have enough resources to do that --&gt; therefore this is not a good idea" .</p><p>in my experience this kind of objections &nbsp;very frequently hijacks&nbsp;&nbsp;good ideas in companies not practicing Holacracy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
