  <dd><p>Hi Margaux,</p><p>Sure, one of our customers asked for it and I felt like it could be useful for everyone.&nbsp;The intent is to allow a little bit of customization for teams that have other info that they might want to associate with a circle. For example, if they&nbsp;use&nbsp;Key Performance Indicators, or links to commonly used circle docs, or a links to other tools that a circle commonly uses. The biggest value I see is for adding more information to the anchor circle, but I'm curious to see how folks use it.</p><p>As Product Manager, I prioritized it in because it seemed generally useful and would meet some tactical needs expressed by customers, and it was a nice, little discrete piece of functionality that could be delivered alongside the performance improvements that we were working on to help GlassFrog's performance for our European folks.</p></dd>
