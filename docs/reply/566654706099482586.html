  <dd><p>It's basically defining a strategy - a&nbsp;heuristic for relative prioritization - which is an allowed lead link function, and because any lead link function can be delegated via governance, I'd interpret that part as allowed, but with&nbsp;only the same force as if a lead link gave that as a relative priority (i.e. it's not a hard rule, there's just a duty to figure out how to integrate and align with it in prioritizing where to direct one's attention). The part I'm less sure about is the demand to inform the Secretary if a meeting will be skipped; that sounds suspiciously like NVGO to me...</p></dd>
