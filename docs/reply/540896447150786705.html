  <dd><p>Our company has 5 partners. We started Holacracy for almost a year without glassfrog. We used a Google Doc (not a Google Sheet) for roles and a separate google doc for Governance Policies. We wanted to start doing Async Proposals. We could not figure out how to do Async proposals successfully with the Google Doc so we became glassfrog premium users.</p><p>We have used Asana to track all of our meeting outputs instead of Glassfrog.&nbsp;</p><p>This week we adopted a policy that said that our Asana Projects = Holacracy circles and that every role has an Asana tag and every task only has one role tag and is assigned to the role holder and is in the correct asana project = glassfrog circle. This structure did cause us to create 2 new circles but ultimately I think that will allow us to get more work done because of the improved tension processing capability.</p></dd>
