  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:551030431173357846]&nbsp;at GrantTree we've spent a couple of years on the question: how do you systematically hire for self-management capability? (We see Holacracy as a system to support our self-management practice).</p><p>We use a structured interview based on some psychology around adult development by Robert Kegan (along with Lisa Lahey, and other collaborators). If you're curious, the chapter on "Working" in the book In Over Our Heads goes some way to explain why the ability to self-manage successfully can be seen in developmental terms. Or if you want to chat on Skype at some point I can do my best to explain it. It's rather long to put all the details here <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
