  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>I know all tensions may be processed outside of Triage, but my question was more about if a meeting (Triage), can be constitutionally made (in that case, continued) by one person, in that case the secretary ? So adding projects/actions for example to resolve his tensions directly etc.</p></dd>
