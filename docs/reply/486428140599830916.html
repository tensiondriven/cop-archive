  <dd><p>I agree with Bernard Marie. The reason is perhaps that the Rep Link is not meant to get&nbsp;requests for actions and projects from the broader circle â€” that's the Lead Link's role. The Rep Link represents a&nbsp;sub-circle, but&nbsp;if someone wants to request actions or projects from a sub-circle, they should direct the request to&nbsp;its&nbsp;Lead Link, not its&nbsp;Rep Link.&nbsp;</p><p>That said&nbsp;sometimes as Rep Link you want to take an action or project for yourself, and it would make sense to me too&nbsp;for GlassFrog to allow it. Maybe with a little warning message that the Rep Link isn't supposed to process requests from the broader circle <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
