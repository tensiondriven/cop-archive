<p>Our Elections that took place on April 6, 2016 we had excluded 2 new team members from the elections process. I as Lead Link took issue with this as against our current governance and constitution however our facilitator allowed the exclusion. So this tension is something we have actually experienced getting in the way of Elections. The initial situation however was intellectual and not actual experience.&nbsp;I believe that this would constitute Breakdown from Unconstitutional Behavior.</p>  </div>
