  <dd><p>Hi Nico, you can add to the proposal of allocating the domain by simultaneously connecting it with a second part that installs a policy that regulates access to that domain (i.e. Outreach can make a proposal for a typical use-case that the Legal Guardian role doesn't object to). It's like the parents saying to the child: "ok, we give you that new bike, but only if you wear a helmet when using it." This way you integrate both needs in one step. Sounds like Outreach doesn't trust that this policy will be created by the Legal Guadian role-filler as promised - that's ok. Just create a policy alongside with creating the domain that grants Outreach access as needed. This way, both tensions (needs) are met at the same time. This is what Integration was meant to be. No need to play the egg-hen game... ;-) Hope this helps.</p></dd>
