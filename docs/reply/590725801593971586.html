  <dd><p>Interesting question.<br />I would assume that the Lead Link would accept responsibility for all tasks not specifically accepted by another role, even if the LL is not present. It would then be the LL's responsibility to assign the task to the role filler and get their acceptance of it.&nbsp;<br />In practice, I imagine that if the Lead Link was not present at the meeting, they should see the task assigned to them from the meeting notes and then have a discussion with the role filler to assign the task.&nbsp;<br />What does everyone else think?</p></dd>
