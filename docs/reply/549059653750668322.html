  <dd><p>Hi Tom,</p><p>“A Partner has a tension that he needs strategic information from the Super Circle to fulfill the purpose of one of his roles”&nbsp;is a constraint that limits the Sub-Circle to be removed within the Super-Circle, which is the exact accountability of the Rep Link.<br /><br /> However, I'd try to solve the tension directly in the Sub-Circle instead of escalating the issue, in order to build a more “ autonomous” option. Note that "Bringing information to the circle” is not a LL accountability". Consequently, LL is not due to give information... so may be there is a lack of role somewhere.</p><p>For instance, you may create in the Sub-Circle a "Strategic information" role whose accountability could be "Bringing all strategic information needed by the circle"... or even directly add this accountability to the Rep Link Role.</p><p>What about?</p><p>Regards</p></dd>
