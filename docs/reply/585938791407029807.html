  <dd><p>Shammi, the LL holds a domain on this and it is the LL accountability to find the best fit for the open roles. Off course if you want to pitch yourself for a role you are free to do this but it is still up to LL do decide if you are the best fit.</p><p>To dispose this Domain and Accountability from the LL means that there need either to be a solid process that ensure best fit for Roles or an person assigned to a Role that is qualified to make good judgement of the available people for the open roles. Can imagine in a highly specialized work field that the LL is not always the best person to judge the fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Waiting for someone to come up is, in my opinion, a bad solution. You want open roles to be filled asap as other Roles may rely on the Accountabilities of these roles.</p><p>Hope this helps</p></dd>
