  <dd><p>Hi Flavio,</p><p>I think you're on the right track here, having the role equally accountable to report on metrics and more detail provided in the required metric, to help the person truly understand what is required here.</p><p>The attention to "not meeting metrics" should be enough to encourage better performance by this individual/create more tension among others who see this as not being met, sufficient that it will move towards further resolution of&nbsp;the item in coming weeks.</p><p>In our experience, employee discomfort among peers in not meeting metrics has usually driven a higher focus by the individual to meet the metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>Good Luck</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
