  <dd><p>I see no reason why the LL would not include targets in the circle metrics. &nbsp;The metrics allow the circle/organization to understand how the circle/role is achieving its given purpose and stated accountabilities. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reviewing metrics during the preamble of the tactical meeting should highlight tensions that can be addressed during the meeting. &nbsp;The LL or other role fillers will likely sense the tension (gap between what is and what could/should be) during the metric review and dig deeper by adding an item to the agenda in the tactical meeting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case that role fillers are best suited to understand the targets for a given metric, they can share their ideas with the LL, who will most likely adjust the metric target.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this helps.</p></dd>
