  <dd><p>I will need to think on this a bit more.</p><blockquote><p>(Although that might only be apparent and relevant&nbsp;if/when&nbsp;you get through the initial practice phase and&nbsp;to a more mature practice.)</p></blockquote><p>Yes, we're certainly in the initial phases.</p><blockquote><p>tension"&nbsp;points to an experience - a feeling - where "issue" points to&nbsp;a thought - a mental construct.</p></blockquote><p>This was very enlightening. I was previously thinking of a tension as "the gap between how things are and how they could be." But really -- if I understand you correctly -- a tension is the *feeling* produced by that gap. How would "a Tension" compare to "a frustration"?</p><p>I think my misunderstanding stems from the way we talk about Tensions. For example, emphasis mine, in one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zGLJRpAKS6E?t=24m14s" target="_blank">videos</a> linked on the home page: you define Tension as "<strong>the feeling</strong> you get when <em>you sense <strong>a gap</strong></em> between what is and what could be." The tension is the <strong>feeling</strong>; the gap is the <em><strong>thing</strong> you&nbsp;sense.</em> But then you immediately say, "..Anything I sense, any <em><strong>tension</strong> I sense</em>, any gap, anything that could be better.."</p><p>Although Tension is correctly defined, it's used as it if is the gap itself. I haven't checked everywhere, but I'm pretty sure that available materials consistently refer to "sensing" tensions, when really, a tension is <em>felt</em>, not <em>sensed.</em></p><hr /><p>Some additional context: several people -- a majority of the (given: few) people I have talked to about Holacracy outside of Snowdrift.coop -- have expressed distaste for Holacracy's "overloading terms". So I went looking for places we could potentially cut down on them, and ended up here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
