  <dd><p>[@mention:576648489231374882]&nbsp;In such case, I would recommend to create a new role and then find somebody who has the best fit for such work. And face reality in case there is no or low skills to fill such job. Nothing to do here with Holacracy. To run any business, you need skills. And bringing such skills into the org. is work by itself - could be done by training or hiring. Or decide not to do such new work as a consequence of a conscious choice.</p></dd>
