  <dd><p>Makes sense Andrew; and mapping your current model makes sense to me as a starting point - the structure will evolve over time&nbsp;once you start running Holacracy governance meetings, so the goal at launch is just to map what's actually happening now, not to try to change anything. &nbsp;If you're running in cross-functional teams now, just map that as-is, one circle per team. &nbsp;And if people are filling roles in multiple circles upon occasion, that's just fine - people are not assigned to circles in Holacracy, but rather can fill roles in any/many circles...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
