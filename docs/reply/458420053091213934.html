I have found that when channeling tensions-about-Holacracy <em>through</em> Holacracy ("I use a formal Holacracy meeting to process a frustration I have with Holacracy"), big aha-moments can occur! There is something very powerful in "closing" the system, in making it formal and binding (as opposed to using "inspirations from" Holacracy or other systems, which then ultimately always rely on informal power structures). Possibly food for another thread rather than this one, but I was too excited to hold back. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" /></p></dd>
