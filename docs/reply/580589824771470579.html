  <dd><p>Are there any Holacratic organizations in NY, NJ, CT, MA, or VT that would allow someone to observe. The closer to eastern NY ~1 hr above NYC, the better because the shorter the drive. Thanks so much.</p><p>(I'm trying to study holac organizations to learn the differences between ones that use volunteers and ones that only have paid employees.) I would love to attend the NYC training but it is not accessible to our budget yet.</p><p>Take care, P</p></dd>
