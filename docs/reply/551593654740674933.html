  <dd><p>I actually have a note in my system about this - I was wondering similarly if it would be constitutional either in theory or in practice. I suspect that theoretically it is fine, but I wonder if there are any "gotchas" that might degrade Holacracy practice especially for new orgs in practice. I'm sure if I really thought about how it would work in GlassFrog, it would &nbsp;become clear if there would be trouble. But, I'd be curious to hear Brian's thoughts as well.</p><p>Also, glad to hear you've been thinking about it and have actual use cases - I was wondering if I was just designing from mind when I was thinking about it last.</p></dd>
