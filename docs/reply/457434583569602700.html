  <dd><p>Anchor Circle purpose is like a big-picture guidance type thing. Sort of where the company is going as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The circle would be a part of the circle but only be able to be filled by members who are worker-owners. The role that would like to be expanded into a circle is the Development Think Tank.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose is: Strategies for growth and development.&nbsp;</p><p>Accountabilities: Researching &amp; analyzing scenarios and proposals for company growth and development</p><p>Soliciting and integrating input from other circle members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason they want it to be a circle, is so that when they have meetings, it will be captured in GlassFrog and everyone in the company can see what they're working on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
