  <dd><p>Great explanation Margaux, If I were in a hurry, I would have probably&nbsp;talked to the&nbsp;Lead Link of the target Circle first, only if one of the&nbsp;following condition was true, I would &nbsp;then have taken the Rep Link way.</p><p>1) Purpose of the Circle in which you want the accountability&nbsp;to be added to a role &nbsp;not in line with the proposed accountability</p><p>2) Purpose is aligned but Lead Link doesn't think new accountability &nbsp;is relevant to express it&nbsp;</p><p>3) accountability appears and then &nbsp;is removed&nbsp;but you still need it (for the reason stated by Margaux)</p><p>I am interested in your comments, does it make sense, or would you go the "Margaux way "100% of the times?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
