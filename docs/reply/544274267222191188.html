  <dd><p>Hi Laura,</p><p>If I understand your question&nbsp;its about&nbsp;how different personality types experience Holacracy. Especially the transition into Holacracy provides each individual with a personal journey. its not uncommon that you experience something very postive about Holacracy as well as something negative before you can combine these views.</p><p>For example an affiliation focused person might experience:</p><p>- <em>more affilitation</em> as by the roles you fill in the organization you can now much more relate to the organization's purpose as each role has a purpose as well that makes explicit how it contributes.</p><p>- <em>less affiliation</em> as suddenly there is less of a team definition and the meetings are first about the organization. and it might take some time before there is a real tribe space emerging.</p><p>In this way everybody has their own experience with the journey into the practice of Holacracy. Being clear on what the plus/minus for each personality type is could definitely create recognition and more consideration from everybody.</p></dd>
