  <dd><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hey Daesun! I'll give you a pragmatic rather than constitution-scientific answer:</p><p>3.2.2 "Criteria for Valid Proposals" says: "a Proposal is always valid (...)&nbsp;if it is made solely to help evolve the Circle’s Governance <strong>to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening</strong>" (emphasis mine)</p><p>So one pragmatic way to "create Roles" from scratch is to <em>simply do the job that one wants to see happening</em>, and then come up with a Proposal _that captures the already happening action_.&nbsp;</p><p>This saves you all the trouble of analysing wether or not the Proposal&nbsp;benefits one of the proposers&nbsp;Roles or not.</p><p>This <em>may</em> be a little bit ugly, but it does encourage _action_ (do a thing that one feels needs doing; Holacracy/Governance/Stabilizing comes afterwards) over theorizing ("I <em>think</em> we should have this Role"), so I like it. :-)&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
