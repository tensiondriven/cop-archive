  <dd><p>@Stephan</p><p>We've just shared them at the Holacracy Summer University held in Paris this month with other coaches. The ones we've shared as real ones from clients so we cannot leave them. Let me take a an action to build a template from those without any name.</p><p>Love already your parsing system. We don't have this kind of tools so we calculate metrics manually which is weird. GlassFrog should allow some key metrics generation re Holacracy practice like statistics as - number of roles per circle, number of tensions processed in governance per circle, etc... These are in our experience very useful data to monitor the Holacracy implementation.</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p></dd>
