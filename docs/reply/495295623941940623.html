  <dd><p>Hi, Margaux,</p><p>I think you are fine in requiring sub-Circles to have a specific role. &nbsp;We had a similar need (i.e. tension) that required sub-circles of our Operations Circle to have a role within their circles to act as an SAP Key User.&nbsp;</p><p>We did not enact a policy, rather&nbsp;an accountability was added the following accountability to each of the sub-circles.</p><p><em>Accountability:</em> Identifying and maintaining a role within the circle for an <strong class="highlight">SAP key user</strong>.</p><p>I'm not sure if this was the best approach but it worked for us.</p><p>As for role-filling from above, I think that would need to be addressed via policy (similar to cross link). &nbsp;If you can tell us a bit more about the tension, especially as it relates to the super-circles desire to fill the role, it might help us to better respond.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>- Dennis</p></dd>
