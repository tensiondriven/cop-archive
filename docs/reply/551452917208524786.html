  <dd><p>Marco referred to my blog on the topic of evolutionary purpose discovery.

What makes it strong in my opinion is that integrative decision making ensures you have a statement after 3-4 hours.

They are really surprised that it is indeed possible to figure it out in half a day!&nbsp;</p><p>After each session I conduct I improve the process and feedback is welcome to further develop it.

If then the purpose of the organization is clear and people are aware of their indiviudal purpose beautiful conversations can take place on the resonance between the two.
