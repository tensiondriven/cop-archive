  <dd><p>We meet in person 4 times a year currently, and we are strongly considering raising that to 6. &nbsp;It is definitely an improvement, but I also think there is some natural limit to the improvement based on frequency of in-person. &nbsp;For example, I am not sure that 12 times a year would be twice as good as 6.</p></dd>
