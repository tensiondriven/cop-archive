  <dd><p>Thank you both!</p><p>Brian, that feeling was indeed what I was looking for as our current process time outs feel useful but I want to wean us eventually.</p><p>Christel, I like very much the idea of using check out for feedback however since there is no cross talk during check out. I think I will try to encourage observations during check out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
