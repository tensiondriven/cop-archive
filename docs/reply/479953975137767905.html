  <dd><p>Hi Dien,&nbsp;</p><p>Like Bernard Marie said, the Lead Link doesn't have the authority to mandate a process, you need to go to governance. There are different ways of achieving it. Two examples:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong>&nbsp;A policy that describes the process that every circle member must follow.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Policy</strong>: All roles involved in software development and supporting activities must follow the Scrum process described below:<br />...</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A policy tied to a role. It gives you more flexibility when you want to update the process, as you don't need to propose changes to the policy in governance.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Policy</strong>: All roles involved in software development and supporting activities must follow the process defined by the Scrum Master role.</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Scrum Master<br /><strong>Accountability:</strong> Documenting and publishing<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a process ("Scrum process")&nbsp;to facilitate agile collaboration between software development related roles.</p></blockquote><p>The tricky part with the policy is that you cannot mandate action from other roles, you can only&nbsp;restrict the way something gets done if the roles <em>choose</em> to engage in it. (<a href="wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=policy" target="_blank">see this Wiki page&nbsp;about policies for details</a>). If you want to bring your specific case to one of our coaching sessions, we can look at it in more details.&nbsp;</p><br /><br /><p><em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I'm editing this post to add an <strong>Example 3</strong> that would be more elegant and probably more appropriate.&nbsp;</em></p><p>First, Dien you could ask yourself the question: what is it that you want to expect from other roles?
