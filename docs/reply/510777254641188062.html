  <dd><p>Hi Xavier,&nbsp;</p><p>Based on my understanding of what you're asking, we currently don't have anything in GlassFrog that is simpler than the API to get information to easily email all Facilitators. We have a feature request to help with&nbsp;emailing all Facilitators, Secretaries, etc, and I've (as Product Manager) prioritized that higher to see if we can get something sooner to meet that need.</p><p>I'm curious what you had in mind for a simple query tool, or if you know of an existing functionality that does what you had in mind?</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Lex&nbsp;</p></dd>
