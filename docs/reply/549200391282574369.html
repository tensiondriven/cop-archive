<p>Hey Dadi! Good to hear from you!</p><p>Here are a few thoughts:</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"An 8 hour workday on average is the expected norm during each month."</em></p><p>I'd create a Role for this: "Norm Keeper" "Expectation Keeper" "Company Culture Documentation"&nbsp;or so, and have that role keep records of such general norms/expectations. This makes this manageable, and you can move fluidly between documenting norms freely (in an external system, or as a note in Glassfrog), making them binding policy, or discarding them alltogether.</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"Time registration is only mandatory for client-work."</em></p><p>Not sure I understand this. Are people "registering time" for stuff that they needn't do it for? Then what do they do?</p><p>I think you need some Policy&nbsp;around "client-work" here ("when performing client work, a partner must register their time), and some, hm, clear-up about why people&nbsp;do stuff that is unnecessary. An Email to everyone "stop doing that, people!" maybe. :-)</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"If you use environmentally friendly ways of commuting the organization can provide you with a bus card or, alternatively, a grant of &lt;amount&gt; of money."</em></p><p>This is unclear to me. What role is speaking there? What is their tension? What are you trying to achieve?</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"The organization will pay to replace your phone after 2 years and your computer after 3 years if you request it."</em></p><p>Publish a Note with the Role that takes care of this.</p><p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>"Criteria used to determine salary placement"</em></p><p>Is there a Role&nbsp;that takes care of this? They could publish a Note.</p><p>A few&nbsp;more general notes:</p><ul><li>We still have a "Company Handbook" (and <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/7675000" target="_blank">a Role for it</a>, which I hold)&nbsp;that I am currently trying to reduce to the absolute minimum by converting the "hard facts" content into Policies and Notes, emphasizing the soft, cultural in the Handbook.&nbsp;</li><li>Whenever I publish an important piece of information, I try to&nbsp;add a Note that references it from the Role's page in Glassfrog. We use Trello and Slack and a few other tools too, but ideally I think a new team member should be able to find everything relevant for their job &amp; survival in the organisation by going through Glassfrog.</li><li>(I am thinking about publishing most things as simple notes in Glassfrog, rather than as Documents / PDFs / Trello Cards. Easier to raise tensions about them this way.)</li></ul><p>Does this help? Do go more into depth about what you are trying to do - I'll be happy to&nbsp;wrap my brain about it some more. <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p>  </div>
