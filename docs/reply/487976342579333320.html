  <dd><p>Hi Dien,</p><p>I believe you can rule out all three as "not valid Governance output" (criteria e in 3.2.4, below):</p><p><strong>"(e)</strong> Processing or adopting the Proposal breaks the rules defined in this Constitution, or prompts the Circle or its members to act outside of the authority granted under this Constitution. For example, Next-Actions, Projects, and specific operational decisions are typically not valid Governance outputs per the terms of Section 3.1, so anyone involved could raise an Objection that a Proposal to enact these outputs would violate the rules of the Constitution."</p><p>I think this video, particularly the part at 54:05 (you might need more context. If so, context *ends* at 44:15, I didn't find where it starts) should help</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQU9FcE2NI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQU9FcE2NI</a></p></dd>
