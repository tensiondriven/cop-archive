  <dd>Likewise runs holacracy and a great number of volunteers participate. Since so much of holacracy boils down to the maturity needed for voluntary involvement, our volunteers enjoy autonomy in their roles and energize those roles as fully or infrequently as possible. However, we also have some volunteers that choose not to embrace an ongoing role, too. These are a better fit for +Margaux's insight. I'd be happy to discuss specific tensions at your leisure.</dd>
