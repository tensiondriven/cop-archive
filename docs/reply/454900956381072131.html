  <dd><p>I promote the whole Holacracy implementation as a game just like the famous book the great game of business. I love the idea of gamifying Glassfrog though you have my vote on that. My only caution is it should probably be about using GF for tracking projects and reviewing roles using the my authorities etc I would caution using tensions as a way as it may lead to forced tension or made up one and they really need to be grounded in reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And yes I'm getting a little competitive in this Hoop.la platform but probably just for now until the next skyrim add-on pack is released ;-)</p></dd>
