  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>Sorry for my late reply. Thanks everyone for your inputs !</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[@mention:449974511452179429]&nbsp;Interesting the&nbsp;approach of a domain as&nbsp;an activity/process.&nbsp;Might not be easy in this specific case, but I have to think about it.</p><p>[@mention:449693036337664795]&nbsp;I'm afraid I missed you point&nbsp;on 2.1.3 :&nbsp;"the Circle retains the right [...] to define [...]&nbsp;Policies that further grant or constrain the Role’s authority within the Domain" =&gt; my understanding is that I can have a role with a domain, and&nbsp;a policy at the circle level which&nbsp;constrains the role authority over that domain.&nbsp;So I imagine&nbsp;a domain "Room xxx" on a role and a policy at&nbsp;the circle level allowing use of this room outside "DRP events" would do. What do you think ?</p></dd>
