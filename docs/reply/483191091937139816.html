  <dd><p>Thanks! What you say makes sense, it's just a bit hard to picture because I have never experienced it . I would love to, though. It sounds liberating and empowering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am already trying to plant some holacracy seeds with my boss, as I wrote up a proposal that includes the integrative decision making process. I think it is the most likely part of holacracy to pique his interest because he hates it when people, myself included, tend to bring up side issues when we are trying to solve a problem. He is a big advocate for solving one problem at a time and I think the integrative decision making process would help with that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
