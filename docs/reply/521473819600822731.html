  <dd><p>To add on that, I've already done that one or two in the past years. My intent was to make it clear to everyone that I was going tu run the meeting regularly. I also issued an request in my Sec. Role for everybody to give me inputs re the dates/hours, thinking that may be, the slots I have chosen were not convenient/workable for them.</p></dd>
