  <dd><p>1. Awesome that circle members are bringing up tensions to process in governance</p><p>2. That specific accountability appears to be a combination of a Project "Establishing a role" and an expectation already in the constitution "Energizing a role" therefore, redundant. Perhaps it's NVGO but I think the clarifying question would be around what exactly is the work that this role is expected&nbsp;to do that serves the purpose of the Circle? My reaction is that the current accountability doesn't provide clarity of the actual work that is expected. How does the role filler "energize" the role. Accountabilities need to be more explicit in order to create clarity.</p></dd>
