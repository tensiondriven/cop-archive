  <dd><p>If you have an accountability that says... "Optionally responding to community of practice posts" then I agree it is both redundant and doesn't do anything except confuse the issue since one always reviews accountabilities, acts if appropriate, and then prioritizes those potential actions.</p><p>If it is optional, then it is occasional and therefore simply an accountability. I think it important to keep the focus on each individuals interpretation of the constitution and governance, not something like "it makes sense if it serves the purpose of the role" because in a way that sounds like a new rule... hope that helps.
