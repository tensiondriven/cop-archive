  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:549059653907130620], my organization had a similar&nbsp;need at some point, to create a "Role Market Place" (I don't know if it's the same tension here).</p><p>We initially looked at the API, as I did not find anything in GlassFrog being able to do that (you can subscribe to all circle's meeting minutes, but not assignments).</p><p>We could have developed something (like Zappos did and many others I'm sure), but we finally end-up by creating a policy to post in our internal comm media (yammer) roles without assignment.</p><p>May I ask what's your tension behind you need ?</p></dd>
