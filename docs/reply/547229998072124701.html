  <dd><p>Thank you to all of you who have responded thus far. It seems to be a less complicated issue than maybe I had anticipated (so there I am, doing just what your clients do Daniel!). Sally, thanks for that reminder that it is no different then a Holacratic organisation interfacing with non-holacratic customers. Louis, thanks for the links, which I have look at and read with interest. I will share some of this with my clients.</p></dd>
