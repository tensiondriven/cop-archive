  <dd><p>There is so much in the nuance in the language used here. The term 'The Constitution' resonates, in my view, very differently for a US citizen than it does for citizens of other countries. The UK, for example, doesn't have a written constitution, so it would be rare to hear a reference to a constitution, as if that carried a certain weight and authority, and could trigger a respectful. My preference, when working with non-US citizens, or a multinational group, would be to refer to 'Our Constitution' - an implicit reminder that it is not something that we were born into. Instead, it was co-created by our joint agreement, just as 'the rules' are 'our rules'.</p></dd>
