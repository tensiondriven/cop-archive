  <dd><p>I work with Sam Burnett (above) and want to put another plug in here about humans and holacracy. I think it is very important to help the humans adapt to the change of holacracy in respectful ways. Certain things may push&nbsp;anyone's buttons in any way and in any work structure. Having a change imposed or being too forceful in communication can generate resistance to change. Being clear and&nbsp;respectful (and indeed compassionate)&nbsp;as people experience change builds a strong person, work team and environment that can weather the ups and downs of everything we experience in our work life.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of our organization's mission is helping others with change at personal, organizational and community levels. There is much to learn from these fields that can help with holacracy implementation.</p></dd>
