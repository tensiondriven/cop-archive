  <dd><p>[@mention:550185852389690415]&nbsp;I'd be pleased to provide pro bono facilitation and coaching over Zoom (I'm in Canada) if it would help. I do both roles extensively within my own organization where I have the role of "Holacracy Coach" and also serve as an introductory Facilitator until circles are ready to self-facilitate.</p></dd>
