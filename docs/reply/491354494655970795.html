  <dd><p>Hi Giuseppe,</p><p>Project and actions are tools at&nbsp;your disposal to organize the work to be done as you need. Just do&nbsp;what makes sense for you.</p><p>If relevant, you may set a main project&nbsp; "New feature Y is operational" that you owns in your role "Customer Care”; and if needed, the other roles may create projects for their own parts (graphics, development, etc.).</p><p>Seems that you are already coordinating the project from your role "Customer Care". In order to get some more clarity, you might model your circle governance according to the way your circle actually works: by creating a "project coordinator" role that you'll energize with this "coordinating project" accountability, or adding this accountability to your "Customer Care" role...</p><p>Hope that helps,<br /> Jean-Michel</p></dd>
