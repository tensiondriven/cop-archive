  <dd><p>Thanks&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859]... we're in a general state of trying to decide if/when to add circles vs. keeping things simple as they are now, understanding that adding new circles will necessitate the addition of new lead links/rep links/facilitators/secretaries, etc. &nbsp; Trying to avoid the creation of multiple circles (by discipline) at once.</p><p>Any guidance on how and when to do that? ( recognizing it's a big topic).</p><p>thanks,</p></dd>
