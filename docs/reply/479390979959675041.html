  <dd><p>Hi Dien,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different elements here: accountabilities &amp; domains.</p><p>1/ Accountabilities: yes, it is the Lead Link's duty to differentiate it into one or more role (by creating a new role or adding it to an existing role). Until the governance meeting (or gov out of gov proposal) comes up, it is the Lead Link who fills that accountability. A good Lead Link would definitely not work and differentiate it in governance ASAP.</p><p>2/ Domains: a domain on the circle doesn't have to be broken down into one or more role. It can stay as the “family property” until some tensions arise and you need to put more clarity by delegating part of the domain on a role for example or by defining a policy in the governance of the circle. In this scenario, it would no longer be the family property.</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
