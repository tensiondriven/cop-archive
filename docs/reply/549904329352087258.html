  <dd><p>I agree with Bernard Marie.&nbsp; I have interpreted that accountability of the LL as an ongoing responsibility to evaluate the circle's structure and make proposals as needed to ensure the circle stays aligned to its purpose and accountabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is particularly important when the circle, once already established, gains new accountabilities or a changed purpose.&nbsp; All circle members can contribute, but the LL is specifically responsible for doing it.</p></dd>
