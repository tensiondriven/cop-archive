<p>Hi there. &nbsp;I am interested in the reason why they are not fulfilling a certain accountability - particularly if it is the one about providing feedback to other people and tackling potential under-performance that is normally associated with this.</p><p>Have they not spotted that they need to provide feedback to another? &nbsp;Do they not have the skills or the confidence to provide this feedback? &nbsp;Are they refusing to? &nbsp;For me, each could require a different approach. &nbsp;If it was me, I would err towards a quiet off-line conversation first, to draw the issue to the LL's attention and I would use a coaching approach to get them to realise the negative impact their behaviour is having. &nbsp;</p><p>Not very Holacractic I know, but if it is the LL's capability or they just don't know how to do something, they might be able to realise they need to find a solution without going through the embarrassment of being publicly pulled up on it.&nbsp;</p><p>If this doesn't work, then I agree raising it as a tension as you suggest. &nbsp;And if that doesn't work, then I agree with Daesun's approach above.</p><p>Best of luck</p>  </div>
