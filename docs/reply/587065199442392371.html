  <dd><p>Hi Marco,</p><p>A team is not necessarily a circle. So I can imagine the&nbsp;Customer Service Desk role lives in one circle. You don't want all 30 partners in every meeting, but you do want the role to be represented. Help them craft a policy to do that, see <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art232" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2.3.2 Exclusion for Multi-filled roles</a>.</p><p>Regarding the Team coordinator role, make sure to unpack the work of that role into accountabilities.</p><p>Maybe the person filling the Team coordinator role is also the one representing the Customer Service Desk role. It doesn't matter, just help them define their solution in that policy mentioned above.</p><p>Cheers, Koen</p></dd>
