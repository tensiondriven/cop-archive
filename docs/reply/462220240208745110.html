  <dd><p>Hi All,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be able to access the results of the survey by clicking on <a href="/surveys/skills-development-survey-1?results=true" target="_blank">Show Results&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;and then "answers submitted" to see the comments added. I put the results together in a spreadsheet and it shows that developing skills as a Facilitator, Lead Link and Governance were high. Other nuanced skills such as working with people being scared to trust the process and GTD were included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for your input!</p></dd>
