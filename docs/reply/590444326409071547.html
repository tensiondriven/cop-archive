  <dd><p>[@mention:577633875651499938]&nbsp;Great topic!</p><p>We used to follow a principle, that you cannot just state what values you want, because they are in people who are working in a company. So we had whole day onsite workshop to discover and agree on company wide values according to Barrets approach.</p><p>As a former CEO I&nbsp;felt tensions about this approach, as I find it necessary to distinguish between personal, teams and organizations values.<br />Orgs. values I believe are part of business model. The way we want&nbsp;to appear to our customers as we find it necessary to achieve our purpose.&nbsp;With that in mind, I think company`s values&nbsp;can&nbsp;be strategies in Holacracy.</p><p>IMO resitance&nbsp;might come from the inside of people, beacause you try to&nbsp;set personal/teams values which cannot be set. If you want to setup org. values, then I would suggest a strategy proces/meeting where you get input.</p><p>What values are trying to guard as a values guardian&nbsp;(personal, teams, orgs)?</p></dd>
