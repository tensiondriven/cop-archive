  <dd><p>I think the challenge here is that Holacracy is not just a different methodology, but a different KIND of different.&nbsp;</p><p>Most don't even realize that they have a default "operating system." It is not something they see...it is the position FROM WHICH they see.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Holacracy will naturally be misunderstood upon initial inspection. Resistance to implementing something that "wasn't invented here," makes a lot of sense. But Holacracy doesn't actually restrict them in the way that they think it does.&nbsp;</p><p>It is really about education. Or more accurately, providing people the opportunity to get experience. Then (if we are lucky), they may start "seeing" themselves and new possibilities for the first time. &nbsp;</p></dd>
