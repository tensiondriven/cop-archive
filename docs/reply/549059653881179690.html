  <dd><p>Hi Tom, not valid governance input IMO.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider this (more extreme) example: I sense that my salary is not enough. And I propose a policy that states "when making a salary proposal it has to be above $3.5M". (Not saying this is valid...). Imagine doing integration and still solving the original tension...&nbsp;</p><p>That's not supposed to come through governance from any person. And hence governance is intended to come from tensions from a role. The route to take it to give these tensions to the "HR" role &nbsp;and have that role make a proposal on behalf of the organization.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
