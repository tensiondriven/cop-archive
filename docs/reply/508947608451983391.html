  <dd><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>As this circle needs to share a lot if information, this items was added to the check list (when the circle was pretty new) as a warning before creating the agenda.</p><p>Main idea is to ask to each circle member:<br /> Do you have information to share =&gt;Yes/No<br /> If yes, add this point to the agenda</p><p>To be clear, wording of this item should be "Information to share" instead of "Sharing Information".</p><p>Just know:</p><ul><li>That sharing information takes usually more than 2 minutes, so it is helpful for the Facilitator to know how much "information tensions" he will have to manage.</li><li>As the circle is more and more Holacracy mature, circle members get the habit of&nbsp;adding an "information place holder to the agenda", so this item is less and less relevant</li></ul><p>Regards,<br />Jean-Michel</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
