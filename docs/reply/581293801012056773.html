  <dd><p>I thought of another parallel with community theatre. The actors with more stage time and more prominent characters are called "leads." They are often more experienced actors and are sometimes looked to as leaders, although officially, they have no more authority than any other performer. Some lead actors abuse this "shadow power," demanding that their whims be catered to or disrespecting those with smaller roles.&nbsp; Of course, there are wonderful lead actors who wear their influence with grace and integrity, never asking for special privilege and even standing up for those with less of a voice.&nbsp;</p></dd>
