  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>in my opinion, there is no gap in the Constitution. In Art. 2.1.1 it says:</p><p>"Further, each Circle may control its own functions and activities, as if a Domain of the Circle, for the purpose of defining Policies that limit the Circle’s Roles."</p><p>Therefore a policy can limit all functions and activities of the Roles within the Circle. This in combination with:</p><p>"You may also define <strong><em>“Policies”</em></strong> for your Domains, which are either grants of authority that allow others to control or cause a material impact within a Domain, or limits on how others may do so when otherwise authorized."</p><p>gives a pretty good definition of what a policy is.</p></dd>
