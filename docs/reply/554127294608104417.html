  <dd><p>Hi Florian, very interesting topic!</p><p>What I can share with you is what we have realized to be for us the major transformational pains and they are all related to personal development. Holacracy will ruthlessly push any partner in the corner before or later in the process to deal with their personal development, it is inevitable. That eventually trigger either great transformations or great disappointments and fight-backs. When that turbolence mounts up, your organization need to be strong enough to go through the storm. For me, that is the readiness you need to look for. What makes an organization strong enough to pass that storm? It has to do, in our understanding at Business School Lausanne and our 18 months holocratic journey so far, with <strong>corageous leadership</strong> (does the organization have enough personal development champions that can play that courage in the right way?) and how the organization can develop it and support it. So I am tempted to answer to your question saying that any organization would have some corageous leader (and I don't mean only the one that signs the constitution, as he/she will have their own very troubled journey to go through) and they could go for it. They would though have to be ready to develop that courage further and support it.&nbsp;There are different ways to do so...</p></dd>
