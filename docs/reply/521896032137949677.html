  <dd><p>I've experienced something similar in Governance. I present a proposal that someone has an objection that my proposal may&nbsp;cause confusion. My objection to the objection is that it is not confusing and nobody will perceive it as confusing, and if they do, it is not causing harm. There seems to be a stalemate at this point. I've seen "confusion" as an objection a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I debate whether confusion is a valid objection.</p></dd>
