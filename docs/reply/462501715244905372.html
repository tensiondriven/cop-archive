  <dd><p>Hi Keith, Brian,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We've experienced it with a long-term contractor and the main reason it didn't work is because the person was bringing tensions that had nothing to do with our company but she was trying to process her own company's tensions. And the second reason was because we couldn't modify the roles as needed from tensions we've faced because the contractor would object that she can't do it or we would need to pay more... At the end, we thought of having this person has a part time partner but it didn't make sense neither so we went back to “role-filler manage the relationship with this contractor directly”.</p></dd>
