  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>Maybe this resource will help clarify it a little. <a href="http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Policy">http://wiki.holacracy.org/index.php?title=Policy</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to remember is that a Policy enacted on say the Anchor Circle would by necessity apply to the General Company Circle as the GCC,&nbsp;in the scope of the Anchor Circle, is one of it's roles (so that circle as a member role would have to abide by that policy). This would mean that the Policy would be defined on both the Anchor Circle, the GCC and inherited by&nbsp;any Sub-Circle there in by default (this is in some ways the reason to carefully consider the Organisations Anatomy/Structure).&nbsp;So essentially Policies have a cascading nature by default, you would need to stipulate specifically within the Policy Scope if it were to apply to the relevant Circle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Only</span>.</p></dd>
