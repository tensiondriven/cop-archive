  <dd><p>Hi, Andrei:</p><p>A little side observation:</p><p>Dropping a proposal can only happen if the original proposer decides to do that, it can not be done just because objections are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>In the integration round, the objector has to come up with a counter proposal that will still address the original proposer's tension. &nbsp;If the counter proposal is not good enough, then the proposer will need to, again, counter with a different proposal. &nbsp;This goes back and forth until a proposal that's "safe and good enough to try" is found.</p><p>In your example, perhaps, one approach is to ask why the proposer needed to relax the requirement and then try to solve that a different way, i.e. other than by changing the threshold.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
