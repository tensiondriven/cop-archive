<p>I have done some searching over last couple of months, and i have found very little that was helpfull apart from traditional vision mision and strategy literature.&nbsp;</p><p>Untill someone told me "it is simple: write down the purpose you think you have &nbsp;and dont spent to much time on it. check if it is safe enough to try and then try it. &nbsp;from there on, improve it. This way it is more evolutionairy instead of intelligently designed.&nbsp;</p><p>If this still is difficult&nbsp;try some exercises that get people in the mode of longterm thinking</p><p>"dream of the perfect future for your company" or "what would make you very happy and proud in regards to your company" in 10 years.</p><p>goodluck</p><p>"it has to be easy" <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />)</p>  </div>
