  <dd><p>We were in a similar situation, looking to replace Skype with something else, and also chose to move to Slack.</p><blockquote><p>Do you&nbsp;use private&nbsp;channels for&nbsp;core circle members&nbsp;/ roles [only]&nbsp;in specific circles?</p></blockquote><p>Most circles have public channels, with very few exceptions for circles that deal with sensitive data.</p><blockquote><p>How much transparency is there across the organization in slack?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>We generally have a lot of transparency within the organization, but I feel that's not necessarily due to slack.<br /> In my eyes one of the best arguments for slack (vs Skype groups) is discoverability - with the channel list you can find whatever group you may be looking for, rather than needing to know that it exists and ask someone to invite you.</p><blockquote><p>Do you have policies for being a member in a slack channel without participating in it? (auditing / listening in)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>No, nothing like that</p><blockquote><p>Do you use more than one workspace?</p></blockquote><p>We only use one workspace, with about 160 people (though with external guests we're at about 600 slack users).</p></dd>
