  <dd><p>Adam:&nbsp; I've heard that reflection before, several times.&nbsp; And I've heard the exact opposite reflection as well from others, several times.&nbsp; I'm not&nbsp;entirely sure what to make of that.&nbsp; My own perspective is that I have yet to see this meaning-making (Holacracy as masculine or feminine) as notably useful, regardless of which side of that polarity one decides Holacracy falls within.</p></dd>
