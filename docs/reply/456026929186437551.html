  <dd><p>Hey Fajar,</p><p>In reading your post I'm sensing that you may be misusing domains in the Holacracy sense. A domain is a piece of organizational property that can be given to a role to restrict or authorize access to that property. &nbsp;In what I've read there doesn't seem to be a domain around the type of technology or architecture unique to any role.</p><p>One thing to consider, while the Lead Link holds undifferentiated work of the circle like deciding architecture and technologies right now until it gets split into a separate role. &nbsp;Which if the work of that is ongoing the Lead Link should be bringing that tension to make it clearer. &nbsp;Equal to the point you can propose another role to make those kinds of decisions or create a policy granting that authority to decide those things for any role that needs to.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p></dd>
