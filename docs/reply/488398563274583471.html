  <dd><p>I disagree. It's not amending the governance process, it's just using another channel to execute it. In the plan I outlined we still are using the asynchronous process through Glassfrog, just expediting and giving the room for feedback through slack. Still uses the IDM process.&nbsp;</p><p>In 3.2.1 of constitution it says 'A core circle member may distribute a proposal to all other core circle members asynchronously, outside of a governance meeting, using ANY written communication channel approved for this purpose by the circe's secretary."</p><p>I'm interpreting this as it is the secretary's call to introduce this method, and also their duty to ensure that in executing it, nothing is unconstitutional.</p><p>I think it's important to explore more methods to enact governance to fit your organization. In our case, we need something that allows asynchronous proposals to be put through&nbsp;with some more discussion and context, rather than putting it in a 'black box' of the Glassfrog&nbsp;asynchronous&nbsp;proposal process. We cannot always schedule special governance to meet our regular needs.</p></dd>
