<p>Hi Everyone - Thanks for replying.</p><p>Eric - Appreciate your comments very much. &nbsp;I am&nbsp;struggling with your reply on a number of levels:</p><ol><li>Regarding your belief in intent - My take on holacracy is a&nbsp;system based on explicitness, and to use the argument of intent is quite a slippery slope, that could be applied to way too many things. &nbsp;Regarding the grammar in&nbsp;section 4.1.3.C, it seems very&nbsp;explicit, rather than implying. &nbsp;That is, when writing "this&nbsp;1, this&nbsp;2, and other items", all this's are classified by the "other items"&nbsp; i.e. "BMWs, Fords, poodles and other cars" wouldn't make sense.</li><li>In the section 1.2.5, I do see the title "Attention &amp; Resources", I see your point that both in a title would indicate they are different, but it's not titled "Time &amp; Resources" and doesn't explicitly define the relationship between time &amp; resources. &nbsp;In that&nbsp;regard, I could&nbsp;interpret that Attention is a "use" of time, and time meaning "available human resource".</li></ol><p>But that is just wrangling with the legalese of the constitution. &nbsp;I guess for me, most importantly, is that I'm struggling with the logic that:</p><ol><li>If Money is a resource, and&nbsp;</li><li>If a lead link&nbsp;allocates&nbsp;money for a role to purchase external services, the external services are a resource (even rented services such as a building lease).</li><li>But the moment a Lead Link allocates money to pay for an "internal human resource" whether as a partner/employee, their available time is no longer a resource.</li></ol>  </div>
