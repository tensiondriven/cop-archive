  <dd><p>@Kevin / @Dien, on shared feeling of ownership, I see 2 angles:</p><ol><li>The Circle often has this "shared" feeling, people do tend to feel connected to its purpose and not just their own roles. Our OKRs (the way we define strategy) also help here.</li><li>Projects are often "shared" by multiple roles. Indeed with clear governance supporting that&nbsp;(or easily&nbsp;created, we do weekly governance meetings), and almost always a project is split up in projects per role with clear outcomes that support eachother. These projects are also part of a mother project that either act just as a handy overview or is really owner by a role too, so you can have a "sub-project"</li></ol></dd>
