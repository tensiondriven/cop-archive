  <dd><p>What I find much more important than translating the glassfrog interface is to have an option to switch between languages of role descriptions (Name, Purpose, Domain, Accountability)! We are working in English and German at our company and are facing the problem that some Circles use German Role Descriptions and other Circles use English Role Descriptions.</p><p>Teaching English to all employees is not an option.</p><p>Essentially we need all roles in both languages but Glassfrog doesn't allow us to do that. All roles would get really messy if we just cramped both languages into one role description. A switch between languages would do wonders for us.</p><p>Big tension here! i suppose that other international companies are facing the same problem or will be facing the same problem. Please make such an option available as soon as possible.</p></dd>
