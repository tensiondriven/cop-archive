  <dd><p>hey @Joe, yeah I know that can cause some confusion. My reasoning for keeping it "Project Updates" is because it seems more intuitive for new practitioners to understand. And the cards are oriented towards new practitioners.&nbsp;</p><p>I think an "update" as in "project update" captures the meaning of "progress" well enough; update = progress. Though of course sometimes you need to clarify that the update is not intended to be a status report.&nbsp;</p><p>Although something like "Project Progress" may be workable. I'll definitely consider it.</p></dd>
