  <dd><p>Thanks Daesun and Julia! &nbsp;Those are both very helpful solutions. &nbsp;To give a bit more context, we are just starting out with Holacracy. &nbsp;Even before we decided to transition, feedback was an expectation of the lead, but we found that it frequently did not happen. &nbsp;</p><p>This is for a variety of reasons but the two most common are that the lead does not feel comfortable giving feedback/lacking the skills, and the second reason being that&nbsp;feedback is not top of mind so they don't set time aside for it. &nbsp; We're not confident that just clarifying this as an accountability within the lead link role will resolve either of these issues, so having a couple options for each situation as you've provided is a huge help!&nbsp;</p></dd>
