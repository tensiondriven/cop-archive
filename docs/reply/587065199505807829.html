  <dd><p>We're facing&nbsp;a similar issue, having 12 role fillers for one role.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a trade-off. Having all partners as core members in the circle, slows down Gov and Tactical meetings a lot.</p><p>Excluding them and having them represented in the meeting by just one partner, makes the meetings more efficient, but results in fewer tensions being discovered/resolved by this role.&nbsp;</p><p>With us, the system evolved so far into:</p><ul><li>Role XY (each Partner is assigned to one of 2 groups/teams)</li><li>XY Facilitator with Purpose: XY are realizing and resolving their tensions</li><li>XY&nbsp;Representative with Purpose:&nbsp;XY stays up to date with changes in circle;&nbsp;XY's tensions are resolved</li></ul><p>XY&nbsp;Facilitator is chosen by the LL of the circle, XY Rep is elected by the team. Both are at the same time also role fillers of Role XY.</p><p>Each team has a weekly or bi-weekly short meeting to "bring up all tensions".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, that's all work in progress and due to fewer tensions being discovered/resolved, we're not entirely happy with it yet and are looking for the next step forward <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
