  <dd>Hey Margaux,<br /><br />Yep, those are definitely the challenges Iâ€™d anticipate. Yet, they are as much about maturity of boundary-management skills as they are about the contractor relationship structure. Many new full-time partners also wrestle with bringing proposals into governance that are really about serving their personal goals/needs vs. supporting the organization's purpose. I think a contractor relationship can make that even more challenging to navigate (how much probably depends on the contract terms and compensation system at play), yet someone with the right level of boundary-management skill should be able to do so just fine, even in a contractor relationship...<br /><br />- Brian</dd>
