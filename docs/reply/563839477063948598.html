  <dd><p>Thank you both for your ideas. I do like the idea of hours of operation being in governance especially as a preschool because it is a factor that is changeable if parents wanted us to open earlier or teachers wanted us to close earlier or vise versa. I think the tricky part for us is developing clear governance for all. I would be curious why hours of operation is "wrong in theory" I think a policy that says "Doors remain locked until 7:30am." or "Entry is permitted after 7:30am" is not governing people but property. It's just a lot to tease out of the old handbook style thinking. Thanks for the dialogue and I'm interested in others ideas too!</p><p>Jenn</p><p>PS. I will check out the contract video.</p></dd>
