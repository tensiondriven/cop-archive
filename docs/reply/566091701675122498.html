  <dd><p>Hi Andrew - I actually recommend against this practice; there are better ways to encourage ownership and follow-through that don't suffer from the downsides of this approach. &nbsp;Those downsides can be summed up by creating a pressure towards&nbsp;what David Allen calls "chasing the latest and loudest" - it creates a strong push&nbsp;for people to do those next-actions that came from tactical, even when they aren't the most important&nbsp;actions to do. &nbsp;If you feel the need for this (and the need might be very real), you have a deeper issue in people's capacity to self-manage;&nbsp;patching the issue with action follow-up in tactical usually&nbsp;makes the problem worse, or at absolute best only treats the surface symptoms. &nbsp;Instead, look to installing solid GTD practice on the team; when combined with solid Holacracy practice, that should address the tension much more deeply and remove the felt need for this solution.</p></dd>
