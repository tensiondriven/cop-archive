  <dd><p>[@mention:508243854762339714], I could be wrong since it's been a while since I read it, but doesn't&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;cover this in his book?</p><p>I seem to remember reading somewhere that if you're doing a company reorg, then the existing structure informs subcircles and their roles. If you're organization is a startup, as ours was/is, then mimicking an existing organization can be helpful up to a point. Following a more organic and ’just in time’ process, we have roles that multiple individuals energize with a specific accountability stressed (e.g., in "Finance" we have someone responsible for daily records, someone else for regular review, etc.) The role is simple enough and the organization young enough that this makes sense for now. As Likewise College grows, this role may or may not need to become a subcircle. If the need does arise, then the role stewards should raise that tension when they sense it. From there, the governance process takes over.</p><p>There may be other ways to approach the creation of subcircles, too. Our organization’a best results are coming from defining and energizing the minimally necessary roles, adding people to roles until enough people are energizing them that a subcircle can function (i.e., enough for LeadLink, Facilitator, Secretary, &amp; RepLink core roles), and protecting the tension-driven movement of the role to become a subcircle when absolutely necessary.</p></dd>
