  <dd><p>[@mention:476575990100578797]&nbsp;Here is my write up of the tensions this amendment solved. In my organization I, as the "manager" of the LLC am the ratifier of the Constitution.</p><p>I am sorry for the delay in my response. I wish I could pull up in glassfrog how I had my tension worded there, it could have answered a lot of this questions without need for typing it again for your reading <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tension behind the adoption of this constitutional amendment:</p><p>Firstly constitutional amendments do not have to be tension driven in the same way that governance has to be.&nbsp;</p><h3>5.5 Constitution Amendments and Repeal The Ratifiers or their successors may amend this Constitution or repeal it entirely, using whatever authority and process they relied upon to adopt it. Amendments must be in writing and published where all Partners of the Organization can access them.</h3><p>When I show up in the Team Happiness circle I struggled with what role I was representing. I was representing my Board Founder Context role when I was showing up in Team Happiness. I sensed that when we were having Team Happiness circle meetings it was many times uncomfortable and less than ideal to not have at least a Cross Link from Partners representing the voice of the partners. When dealing with employment relationships it is nice to have the voice of the partners, voice of the role assigners, and the voice of the Founder Context all represented. Prior to this amendment We experienced that partners were feeling controlled without representation.</p><p>When we are in the Team Happiness circle I had a tension with roles being assigned. Benefits role was assigned to a person who had different ideas on how to energize the role than how the majority of the Team Happiness circle core members sensed would be best. Therefore the Team Happiness circle roles being elected is an improvement and the circle not having a Lead Link is great. The Facilitator is allowed to decide to use a different election process at their discretion. This is appreciated because some roles are a quick everyone agrees that one person should fill and we don't have to take the ten minutes that integrated election takes.&nbsp;</p><p>Relationship Contracts: I didn't exactly have any tension that caused this section.&nbsp;</p><p>Working agreements: We used to have a Team Member role that was being used as the things that we expect every partner to do inside of each of their roles. The Team Member accountabilities became our working agreements.&nbsp;We had a situation this year where we had a partner where they did not want to abide by our Security policies. The working agreement section greatly clarifies how this would go down.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of extra sophistication than the tensions that I sensed but ultimately I think that it was better as a whole than to take pieces away from it at least to try it.</p><p>Glassfrog is not up to not removing the rep link assignment. The work around doesn't seem ideal to me at the moment. I appreciate being able to keep the history especially in this circle so I am okay with keeping the expired rep link assignment for the moment. &nbsp;I actually believe at this moment that saying that the circle does not have a Rep Link is excessively complex, but not enough for me to want to amend the constitution again.</p></dd>
