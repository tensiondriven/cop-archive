<p>Thank you Dennis!</p><p>Yes indeed, I agree that would be a workable option. Just I feel here I couldn't have solved my problem with it, because I had this tension as Lead Link of the General Circle.</p><p>I'm personally neither filling the Outreach nor the Legal Guardian role. So when proposing the domain to resolve my tension which I felt as LL, I don't feel like being in any position in which I could've added a policy with it right away (after all, I don't have knowledge on it and also Legal Guardian will first need to research it).</p><p>Okay, an option would be to not resolve my tension right away, but to request a project by Legal Guardian, in the course of which they likely would've added a Gov proposal anyways.&nbsp;</p><p>But somehow it felt wrong, to leave a tension which could be critical for our organization (temporary) unresolved.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
