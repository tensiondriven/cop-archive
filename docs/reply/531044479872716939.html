  <dd><p>@Tyler, it seems to me that if a role has a domain, then it must have at the very least the purpose of justifying and protecting the domainâ€™s existence. If memory served, a role has a title, a purpose, and may have a domain and/or accountability. With regard to accountability, what can the organization expect of the role regarding its stewarship of this domain? It'll help me understand better to learn the role title and domain.&nbsp;</p></dd>
