  <dd><p>A proposal to remove an accountability can only be made through the governance process (Const. 3.1).&nbsp; Any core circle member can make such a proposal, including but not limited to the lead link (Const. 3.2).&nbsp; Any core circle member can raise an objection to the proposal during the objection step of IDM, including but not limited to the lead link (Const. 3.2).&nbsp; The lead link does not carry special authority, on his or her own, to veto such a proposal or make such a change.</p><p>As for "transfer another role in the circle," I don't know if you mean that the proposal was to transfer the removed accountability mentioned above or to make some other kind of transfer (such as transferring that role from one role-filler to another).&nbsp; This meaning would impact whether it's an IDM decision or a lead link decision, but changing the role's accountabilities is always a governance issue.</p></dd>
