  <dd><p>A few overnight thoughts.... <img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" /><br /><br />When I talk about values I am specifically talking about the values of the entity that is the organisation. The things&nbsp;the organisation will&nbsp;stand up for and take action on in the world. Or as I said earlier in the thread the essential context within which we will carry out our purpose.<br /><br />In the real world I don't expect that my or anyone else's 'values in practice' i.e. behaviours will always represent the values that we might strive for as an organisation. Indeed it seems likely that some team members values will not necessarily align with all of those of the organisation.</p><p>But because it is an entity that is an organisation having that framework of shared guiding principles seems essential. It's our personality. A way of stretching ourselves towards something more important than what we might each reach as individuals without framework.</p></dd>
