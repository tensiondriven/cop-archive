  <dd><p>Hi, Fred:</p><p>I believe the reason for this isnthat there is already a role that is reaponsible for the whole circle -&gt; the Lead Link.</p><p>The objector can bring it to the lead link to introduce a new tension to fix this if the Lead Link believes it is harming or moving the circle backwards. &nbsp;The Lead Link can ofcourse do this immediately after hearing that the objection was dropped because it was 't limiting the objector's role.</p><p>I also often &nbsp;wonder about this myself,because there is somehow this selfish hints to it, and we all want people who thinks about the whole circle ahead of their own roles actually.</p><p>Anyways, that's the way I understand it <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
