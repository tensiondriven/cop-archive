  <dd><p>If I have a pressing need to comment or inquire about your project, I have a Tension.</p><p>It's okay for a circle member to ask a brief question about&nbsp;a&nbsp;project update for clarity, but if it's a deeper inquiry about the how or why of the project, I suggest that Facilitator should ask it to be captured as Tension to address during Triage.</p><p>Also I like Jenn's suggestions re: coaching circle members on updates, especially if/when a lack of understanding is demonstrated through over-sharing or under-sharing.</p><p>A process time-out is great, or contextual reminder heading into the project update section 'what might be useful for other circle members to know regarding what is different about your project since your last update?'</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
