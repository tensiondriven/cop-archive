  <dd><p>Hi Ali,</p><p>I forwarded the info and both links about your event to Deepak Ramachandran in Bangalore. I also told him why I thought Holacracy was important to things he is working on and forwarded him the link of Brian R talking at Google Talks about Holacracy. That talk is my favorite because the intelligent Google staff asked great questions of Brian. I think it has the best set of Q &amp; A back and forth with Brian of any of the intro talks I have seen about Holacracy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLJRpAKS6E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGLJRpAKS6E</a></p><p>Good luck with your event.</p><p>Pam H</p></dd>
