  <dd><p>I wish I could go to India. I very much enjoyed India the last time I was there.</p><p>I just got off the phone with a friend from India who is living in California. We both think her cousin in Bangalore should go to your event. What is the cost of the event?</p><p>I'm glad that you and Arif are trying to get events going in India. It seems like India would be a fabulous place for both GTD and Holacracy. Ali, I wanted to also say that I really liked your article "20 Things GTD Is Not (And What It Really Is)".</p><p>Take care and good luck,<br />Pam</p></dd>
