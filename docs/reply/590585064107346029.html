  <dd><p>David,<br /> Thanks for the update.&nbsp;I'm really glad you're making progress on this issue.&nbsp;<br />I certainly know what you mean about the internal world and priorities of the founder being very different from the internal world and priorities of team members.&nbsp;<br />Before Holacracy, I felt personally responsible not only for my personal work and the overall direction of the business, but I also tried to be a trainer and mentor (almost a parent) to every staff member. It was exhausting constantly trying to guess what each person needed to fuel their personal and professional growth.&nbsp; What was worse, many of my people were young and used to having their work spoon fed to them, so I felt responsible to teach them how to create and follow through with their projects, ect. And I had to always be ready to catch the ball when/if they dropped it.<br />One of the things that I like about Holacracy is that staff members are now given the space, the time, and a process to express what they need. That frees me up from trying to read their minds. Also, getting everyone involved in creating governance makes them so much more invested in following the rules that they helped to create.&nbsp;<br />I hope you'll keep us posted on the solutions you've found!</p></dd>
