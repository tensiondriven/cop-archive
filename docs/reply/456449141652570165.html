  <dd><p>Hi Andrea,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your message. We deliberated over migrating all of the content from the old Community of Practice to the new platform. The final decision was based on 1) a lot of the content was old and may be out of date/inaccurate and 2) cost/feasibility on this platform, which resulted in making a fresh start with new content and the best of threads from the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will take your suggestions into consideration regarding the old Community. Another options is migrating more recent threads into this Community of Practice now that it is active. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Very best,</p><p>Laura</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
