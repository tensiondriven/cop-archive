  <dd><p>Hi Chris and Romain,</p><p>thanks for your feedback. As you see you can look at things from different perspectives as you did and I, as filling also the role of the secretary, also felt unsure of what to do. The facilitator was not very experienced so actually he counted Objection 1 as valid. Unfortunately, the discussion went on forever and the social tension increased ("almost a breakdown I would say"). I withdrew my proposal to remove the role because I had the feeling that it would shock people too much with this drastic propsal. I could have actually played the card of the secretary and say "this is a valid objection" or "this is not a valid objection"... but am I allowed to interfere in an integration as a secretary without being asked?</p><p>Your hint to testing objections with the question&nbsp;"even with infinite time and money, would you still have this objection?" is very useful and makes the previously mentioned objection 2 invalid in my eyes. This would of course effect also objection 1 but things are getting complicated. I feel one has to take the level of Holacracy understanding/maturity of circle members into account and prepare the ground for big decisions like that. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, I am still left with some unclear overall governance situation with one&nbsp;role X (Human development) and another sub circle Y (capacity building) with similar purposes but the one being more operational.&nbsp;</p><p>I think a good solution could be to propose deleting the "weaker" one (sub circle capacity building) and to invite the stronger one (role human development) as a cross link to cultural life...what do you think?</p><p>Please find some&nbsp;illustration below (because I could not insert screenshots)</p><p>SEKEM</p><p>1.
