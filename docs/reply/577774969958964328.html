  <dd><p>Very helpful, Brian. Yes in this instance it's me as anchor circle facilitator trying to determine what I can reasonably/effectively do vis a vis 'process restoration' - and my own judgments aren't directly at play.</p><p>Yes I have them, I'm human - but if I have a responsibility as partner to comply with duties and constraints of constitution and also to audit and resolve conflicts and rule violations then my&nbsp;@Facilitator&nbsp;actions are unrelated to personal opinion.</p><p>If you might point me to any of the 'educate about the rules' paths, I'd appreciate. I'd like to find a both/and method that is not a public spanking but is additionally a learning opportunity beyond the individual(s). We have a great deal of (mostly well-intended) shadow power to continue to root out.</p><p>Thanks!</p></dd>
