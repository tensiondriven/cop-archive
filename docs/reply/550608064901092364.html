  <dd><p>Hi Tom,<br />I would keep on the process and act as #3.<br />During the integration step of the IDM, you'll be able to deliver coaching about NVGO and about the proper way to write accountabilities.<br />In a more general way, don not hesitate to use the reaction round to deliver coaching...<br />Hope that helps.</p></dd>
