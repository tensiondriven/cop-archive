<p><strong>1. Objections with resource allocation as arguments, such as not enough time, or not enough people. &nbsp;Which test question will rule them out as invalid ? And how ?</strong></p><p>Hey, this is a tough one. You cannot test it with the usual test questions. This is for me the sign the Objector did not get what governance is about. The way I usually do in by giving some coaching here so that they have the opportunity to learn deeper what is governance and then I would simply get back to the Objector and ask again. I would do that either during the Objection Round or during Integration.</p>  </div>
