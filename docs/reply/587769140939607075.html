  <dd><p>We have the same - same person get's re-elected for the same role over and over, mostly until there is a explicit reason to change.</p><p>What I would like to see is that basically everybody gets to "try" every role at least once. This would help everyone to understand the purpose and the why's of the role thus improving their Holacracy-practice.&nbsp;I changed my voting-strategy from "I re-elect the previous one because he did good" to "I'm giving the new guy in the circle a chance"</p></dd>
