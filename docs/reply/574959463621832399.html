  <dd><p>Hey&nbsp;[@mention:454478741268114544]</p><p>I'm curious about what your friend would want to achieve by having three people as LL? <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" />&nbsp;</p><p>It may be that multiple LL-role holders is allowed, but perhaps something else will be clearer. (I am with Tom: "Would I suggest it to do it this way? No!")</p><p>&gt;Imagine the case of a Role that is assigned to Peter, Paul and Mary. Then the Role is expanded to a Circle.</p><p>I also wanted to add&nbsp;that a role isn't automatically expanded to a circle just because multiple people hold it. Making a role into a circle is&nbsp;a specific action in governance. When&nbsp;a role becomes a circle it can&nbsp;be broken down into more granular roles, in a way that goes beyond what you can achieve with focussed assignments to a single, undifferentiated role.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks, Andrew&nbsp;</p></dd>
