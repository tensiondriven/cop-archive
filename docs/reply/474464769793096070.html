  <dd><p>Inspired by the Medicine Wheel of the Native Americans, &nbsp;in the use of which I was trained, I've been&nbsp;tracking the key&nbsp;roles of my personal lifework for 23 years.&nbsp;<br /><br />When in <a href="http://holacracy.zappos.com/public/myRoles/mlLniPtto7nv6yTLYYK-wg.zap" target="_blank">John Bunch's Hola profile</a> I discovered Zappos' Circle of Life, the purpose of which is "<span class="purpose initClosed">A place to create circles about your personal life," and its subcircle created by</span>&nbsp;John&nbsp;and aptly called The John Bunch&nbsp;Circle, I realized that I've been practicing a simplified version of 'solopreneurship' Holacracy for 20+ years before knowing about its formal discipline, tools, and methods.</p><p>Now the dots are connecting, and I will turn my Wheel of Lifework&nbsp;&nbsp;into a 1-person Circle, enhancing it with what I can borrow from Holacracy, while maintaining the&nbsp;rich&nbsp;archetypal connotations of the specific roles that I'm energizing in my lifework. Today is my birthday, a good day to do that upgrade. If anyone is interested, I will post a link to it when it will be done.</p><p>I feel that there's a great potential for solopreneurs in mapping their lifework with Holacracy. Particularly for people with a multi-dimensional lifework, it can help with weekly and moment-to-moment prioritizing, as well as discovering hidden synergies across the roles.
