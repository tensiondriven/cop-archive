  <dd><p>Hi Andrew,</p><p>If you've already 5 teams clearly separated and largely independant, seems reality gives you a good reason for it may beyou didn't catch clearly already.</p><p>• I would have a look at the upper circle. Even if the 5 "line" roles have the same role description, setting a focus to each role holder may give you some more clarity.</p><p>• Another way is to modelize reality by setting 5 different roles (line 1, line 2...) in the stucture and let the process do its work.</p><p>• You could also have a look at the coupling beetwen the differents lines. Low coupling will tell you if the 5 line are really seperated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps.</p></dd>
