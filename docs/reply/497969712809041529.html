  <dd><p>Hi Martin,</p><p>From my perspective :</p><p>• Good starting point by appointing as Lead Link the people who formerly have been leading the department</p><p>• Elect as soon as possible a Rep Link within the sub-circle members after one or to meetings (tactical or Gov), in order to really express the sub-circle DNA through another people than the LL.</p><p>• II really trust that having 2 different people enacting the LL and the Rep link role is a powerful change in the organization transformation.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p></dd>
