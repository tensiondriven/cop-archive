  <dd><p>It&nbsp;is true that as it is formulated in the Constitution it&nbsp;does lead to confusion (2.3.1).&nbsp;In my organisation a Rep Link,&nbsp;who did not go to the course but who has studied in detail the Constitution, is pretty much convinced that we are doing an error inviting the Lead Link of the same circle into the Super Circle. Maybe it is worth to make it explicit?</p></dd>
