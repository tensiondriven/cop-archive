  <dd><p>Hi, Giuseppe:</p><p>Individual actions can only be taken by a role if all the conditions laid out in the constitution for individual action are true.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only an accountability of selecting color is defined for Mobile Designer (no domain), then:</p><ul><li>Mobile Developer can change application color, without taking individual action, if it's needed to express the purpose or one of the accountabilities of Mobile Developer</li><li>Or, Mobile Developer can take individual action when selecting button color is actually not needed to express Mobile Developer's role or accountabilities, but only if all the conditions laid out in the constitution for individual actions are true.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Mobile Designer has the "Application Color" domain, then in most and normal circumstances, other roles, including Mobile Developer, have to get permission from Mobile Designer or follow the policy that Mobile Designer has set to select application color.</p><p>If Mobile Developer wants to break this rule by taking individual action, again, all the conditions laid out in the constitution for taking individual action need to be true, including that the role feels that "the action can't be delayed long enough to get the permissions normally required, or proposing in governance to allow the action without losing much of its potential value"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dien.</p></dd>
