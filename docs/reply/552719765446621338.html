  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:550748956143473957]&nbsp;- we're an entirely remote organization, currently across 4 time zones and two continents... and working through the difficulties of maintaining connection and regular practices. Our US-based holacracy structure I feel is strong, but I'm working on how even to present the tensions that arise from the time-zone difficulties... issues such as whether to have different circles per region (to facilitate governance in that time zone) etc. &nbsp;Would love to hear what you're facing, and what you're doing about it.</p><p>Brandon</p></dd>
