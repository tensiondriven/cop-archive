  <dd><p>A couple of thoughts from me Jenn:</p><p>1. "Be the generic sports car" - this principal for me is about&nbsp;'by default go fast, but in certain areas that are sensitive&nbsp;slow down'. Domains and policies are about saying "these are the sensitive areas".&nbsp;And if this is a sensitive area for the Parent role/circle, then seems like a legitimate speed bump to propose some sort of domain or policy around it.</p><p>2. "Stop, collaborate, and listen" - if the way the Parents circle wants to solve its tension CREATES a tension for you (as LL) - then maybe you have a valid objection, or as we think of it at GrantTree: a valid invitation to collaborate on a solution that meets their needs and your needs. That's what the IDM process is for.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>Andrew</p></dd>
