  <dd><p>Hi James,</p><p>First I am sorry for my english, I am from Qu√©bec and my English is not perfect! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I am new here and your subject took my attention since I fill a Budget and Finances roll in my organization and we are now thinking about a new way to present our Financial information and budgets.</p><p>We are thinking about budgets and accounting by Circles in a way knowing the costs (and revenues if there are) in each Circles. Our actual accounthing system definitely doesn't allow that without a lot of manual process but since we plan to change it next spring, we would like start thinking about what we could do with a brand new system. So I am interested to hear what is done in other Organizations, particularly about cost allocations by roles or Circles.</p><p>So I you are intested to share, I would like to hear where you are in your project now and if some organizations you work with use that kind of accouting and budget by Circles or roles?</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Catherine</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
