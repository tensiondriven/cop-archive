  <dd><p>I haven't read the book, but I'm intrigued.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding: "<strong>adoption:</strong> microstructures are small innovative habits that could prepare the road&nbsp;to an adoption of Holacracy especially in&nbsp;very traditional contexts for which the - Holacracy All at Once or Nothing- approach might be too much to digest."&nbsp;</p><p>I think there are some. I have been working in the <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/80577" target="_blank">Habit Support</a> role within H1 and have been thinking about this a lot. A few of the "microstructures" that I see (if I'm using that word correctly) are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Tactical and Governance Meetings (they are the core sub-system IMO)</li><li>Technology integration (glassfrog&nbsp;usage/comfort, referencing roles in internal electronic communications/systems)&nbsp;</li><li>Personal processing: Projects vs. next-actions, etc. Duties to each other. (this can be delayed until after the core sub-systems have stabilized)</li></ul><p>So, these are just top-of-head examples.</p><p>Regarding these sub-systems, I think of the quote from Animal Farm, "all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others." That is, everything in the Constitution is needed, but some are more needed than others.&nbsp;</p></dd>
