  <dd><p>When an area of the organization isn't as willing to adopt Holacracy, &nbsp;issues requiring group discussion still surface through day to day work and usually the group needs some help as well, with communication. I serve a role in our organization that helps facilitate through these situations.&nbsp;I build a meeting from the tensions I've heard though I'm not going to call them tensions. I build an agenda and entitle meeting/section of the meeting "Opportunities for Improvement" to avoid the "tensions" word.</p><p>In meeting, to drill for proposals from the group, I ask "does anyone have any ideas&nbsp;on how we could we go about addressing/improving this?"</p><p>I find that when areas of the organization don't want to adopt Holacracy, there still needs to be a facilitation of discussions to get to the heart of the concern (root cause analysis). The root cause analysis needing to be performed, has so much parallel with&nbsp;Holacracy's tension processing methodology.&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
