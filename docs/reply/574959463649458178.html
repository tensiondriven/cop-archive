  <dd><p>Hey Keith,&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to your question,&nbsp;"...then are both considered lead link or should one be assigned a 'focus' of lead link?" is, they are BOTH considered Lead Link.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoiding the issue of why it's bad to do this, I can at least say that it is definitely NOT that one of them would have a "focus"&nbsp;of Lead Link, because every role-filler is accountable for ALL of the accountabilities of that role. The focus just specifies some further distinction of&nbsp;application or context to maintain clarity.&nbsp; I want to clear up&nbsp;[@mention:523162737680436711]'s point, "Important in that case is that it is absolutely clear which Focus is doing which Accountability" because that seems to be based on a misunderstanding. If you're in the role, you're accountable for each accountability of that role.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given that, 2.4.2&nbsp;hopefully makes more sense.&nbsp;</p></dd>
