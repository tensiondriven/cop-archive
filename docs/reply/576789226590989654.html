  <dd><p>Hi Ali - To echo Bernard Marie's point, they already need to accept the role assignment,&nbsp;unless they've agreed otherwise (e.g. in an employment contract).&nbsp; But I'd like to add another caution here: it sounds like you're motivated to design something here based on principle, so that it feels less like a management hierarchy.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;often a trap; the goal of Holacracy is not to make things feel less like a management hierarchy or remove management hierarchy dynamics - it's to enable a company to more effectively organize around a purpose.&nbsp; Is the role assignment process you use now getting in the way of expressing that purpose somehow?&nbsp; Do you have a concrete example of&nbsp;how that happened, in a&nbsp;specific case (or many cases)?&nbsp; Or is it just that it feels like the old&nbsp;approach and&nbsp;you want to evolve it from principle?&nbsp; If it's&nbsp;the latter, I'd say resist the urge.&nbsp; If it's the former and you do have a concrete example of where the current approach actually got in the way of getting the work done (not just "it felt like the old way"), then&nbsp;go looking for a solution to that specific tension; know what you're trying to solve for, so you can assess potential approaches against the real tension.</p><p>Good luck!</p></dd>
