  <dd><p>Can I add a follow up question to this: I totally share [@mention:462501715201240916] concern about valid tensions. See, the problem I encountered is that some people use tensions (in a governance context) to shape the&nbsp;organization. This means they don't have an actual problem with something but just like the world to be like they imagine it. This leads to new circles/roles that servce no other purpose than to reflect the inner world of one person.</p><p>I perceive that as an issue&nbsp; because modelling an organization according to a personal inner image is something pretty different than encountering a real problem that has to be fixed. What to you guys think?</p><p>Thanks</p><p><br />JÃ¶rg</p></dd>
