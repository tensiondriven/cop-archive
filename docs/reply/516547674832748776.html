  <dd><blockquote><p>Besides that, do you have any concrete examples of a process to replace the LL authority to&nbsp;assign partners to roles?</p></blockquote><p>One example from HolacracyOne is our <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/1499644" target="_blank">spending authorization system</a>, which no longer rests on&nbsp;Lead Link. &nbsp;Another example is our <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/3625" target="_blank">Role Term</a> policy, which normally constrains a Lead Link from removing people from a role without a second&nbsp;assenting opinion from another role. &nbsp;There are others&nbsp;you can find in our governance as well.</p><blockquote><p>I was thinking about an election process or something similar...&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I'd recommend a lot of caution about that - I think that&nbsp;process has a lot of problems when used for that purpose (for&nbsp;operationally-focused roles), at least in many&nbsp;cases. &nbsp;Don't have time to explain the reasons here further, but I think I may have already in another thread somewhere...</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
