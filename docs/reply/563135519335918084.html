  <dd><p>Thanks Brian for highlighting that.&nbsp;Because of 4.1.5&nbsp;("Implicit Expectations Hold No Weight") it might seem that everything has to be explicit and by my experience the first target of those who start is deeply documenting&nbsp;Accountabilities. Easy to end up to a hyper documented bureaucratic governance. I think that the content of your comment should be added to the new version more clearly somehow. My 2 cents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
