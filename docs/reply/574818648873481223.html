  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:550889693769022824],</p><p>I guess you are pointing to a very important aspect in your last statement. You should probably clarify which role has the authority to take decisions about compensation and with what constraints. Otherwise any change of such policy would result in many "people" being affected. And it can be&nbsp;really tricky in an early practice to sort out role-soul distinctions&nbsp;(eg compensation "it&nbsp;creates harm&nbsp;in all my roles") carefully and&nbsp;ground tensions in reality and objections in roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerald</p></dd>
