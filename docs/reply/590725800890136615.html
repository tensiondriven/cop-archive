  <dd><p>Shammi, the answer is No. The Lead Link would then object towards something that is part of the Accountabilities of the role. If the objection comes from the fact that the Lead Link has no time for this then it is NVGO. Resources is not an valid output for Governance. Roles have unlimited time and are free to decide how to energize their accountabilities.&nbsp;</p></dd>
