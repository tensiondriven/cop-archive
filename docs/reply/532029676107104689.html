  <dd><p>Hi Anja, our organization is process-focused, in a way where we aim to have "live process maps", key working documents help guide our company on a daily basis. We have also adopted Holacracy. When tensions surface, we use process mapping as a means of determining what part of the process is not working, i.e., involves a slight modification or process build-out in an area of process that needs clarification (and corresponding development of roles/accountabilities), or an entirely new process. We have been doing this moreso for the last 4-5 months, and I would be happy to keep in touch on our progress if this might assist you folks as well.&nbsp;</p></dd>
