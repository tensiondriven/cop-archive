  <dd><p>@francescolomonaco, yes there could be an impression that Holacracy is some kind of consent decsion making system. i am glad i am clear and also i see value in not making it a consent decision making system. I see that the leadlink taking the purpose of the organisation further, while the rep bring the tensions from below and that too the objection has to fulfill certain conditions to be valid, and most importantly is it impacting your role. so the blindspots come from the processing of tensions while the purpose is taken care by the strategising and the accountability of assinging roles. Thats how Holacracy navigates the tension between purposeful action and collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is one more question, can we say Holacracy is a collaborative process, it seems yes to me by my definition of collaboration(working together) but may be there are other perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
