  <dd><p>[@mention:577633875653772077]</p><p>Ah, Ok!&nbsp; So, you're right that there are issues with the policies you mentioned (<a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/policies-governing-people-in-holacracy-ffeae61828eb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read general guidance here</a>). Things like requiring team members to update their away times in a specific Google Calendar&nbsp;and another restricting how holiday time can be taken are invalid but you have other options. The main issue with them is that they impact the people, yet "a person" isn't a role and therefore can't object to any of this. So, essentially the organization is unilaterally mandating something and the impacted parties have no direct pathways to do anything about it.</p><p>That's probably the off-ness you're sensing. But there are some simple alternatives. Now, the best solution is really case-by-case, so it might require some more direct coaching because I don't know what might work best for you, and all of these have some downside, but some approaches I've seen work:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Have a role responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;documenting and updating these types of expectations (see our <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/40910" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Partner Agreement Steward</a> role).&nbsp;</li><li>But a Rep-link-type role in the GCC (or whatever circle has the authority over "partner relationships") to represent the partners thus giving them a pathway to object.</li><li>Finally, you can leverage the domain of "Role assignments," to define specific conditions under which someone may be placed in a role. And these can be about the person. So, in my company's case some roles can only be filled by partners with the Holacracy Coaching certificate (e.g. <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/4334" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Holacracy Coach</a>).&nbsp; So, if you need to define specific working hours for specific role-fillers, then it's basically like saying, "Hey, I'm not going to put you in this specific role unless you agree to generally be available for these hours," or whatever. There are lots of potential problems with this, but it might be a step forward.</li></ul><p>And in any of these cases, I don't expect that the overall effect would be much different than how you're using the policies now. But it's a more aligned way to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>---</p><p>Now, regarding this policy,&nbsp;"and another requesting that we avoid the word "staff" in favor of "team member," that one isn't invalid, it's just not a good policy. You can <a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/understanding-policies-d1258264d2ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">read more here&nbsp;in the section "Watch Out for "Should"</a>. Basically, don't use policies as guidelines. Policies should be clear and categorical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there's nothing wrong with publishing guidelines. In&nbsp;HolacracyOne we have accountabilities like "<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/search?organization_id=5&amp;search=guidelines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">publishing guidelines</a>" in several places, but they are all specific to what roles may be doing. It sounds like you're talking about defining some sort of cultural norm, in which case you may want a role to figure out the best way to harvest, publish, and update those guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And this is the rub...we have to clearly differentiate "control," from "influence." Like, when you say, "How do you <em>control</em> word usage?" well, in specific cases of marketing materials or contracts you might actually want governance policies to <em>control</em> usage, but that's all about the roles.</p><p>But when it comes to the people (as people) and how they talk to each other, you can't control that. And I don't mean "you shouldn't." I mean you can't. It's kinda like trying to mandate that "everyone be nice to each other." It's a paradox. What you want is to <em>influence</em> word usage.&nbsp;</p><p>So instead, if you provide guidelines and those guidelines make sense, then people will use them as appropriate because they get it. Not because someone else is telling them that they must. It's a much better way to influence actually.</p><p>Personally, I think this is an important philosophical point, but hard to convey in writing, so I hope that makes some sense (I wrote something on&nbsp;how I think about <a href="https://blog.holacracy.org/four-types-of-power-relevant-for-holacracy-practice-d1afd9bfb717" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">control vs. influence here</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And if you want to explore this more, then I highly highly highly highly recommend reaching out to one of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.holacracy.org/providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">licensed Holacracy providers</a>.
