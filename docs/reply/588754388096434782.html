  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:471649920894755840]&nbsp;Great question! This is not specified by the Constitution. If there is any tension within the *team* (I mean all the people filling that role), they will have to figure it out. Often people are assigned with a Focus or something in order to be compliant to what says the Constitution in section 2.4.2 "A Lead Link may assign multiples people to the same Defined Role, as long as that will not decrease the clarity of who should enact the Accountabilities and *authorities* of the Role in common situations." It states "do not decrease the clarity of who should enact *authorities*", creating Policies is part of authorities, right? So maybe there is something to look at in the manner assignment is done.</p></dd>
