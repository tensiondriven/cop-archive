  <dd><p>Thanks for posting, Mike. I believe you address some very core issues affecting the decision to implement Holacracy or not. I have also been on a journey of investigation with Holacracy over the past year, and I concur that there is no substitute for training and experience ...particularly experience within the relevant culture. If you'd like to understand more about my views, you could read the article I just wrote.&nbsp;<a href="http://spaxman.com.hk/news-events/should-your-organization-invest-in-self-management/" target="_blank">http://spaxman.com.hk/news-eve...-in-self-management/</a>&nbsp;</p></dd>
