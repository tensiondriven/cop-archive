  <dd><p>In my opinion the facilitator is the one who cares least about the outcome of the election. He is merely interested in the fact that there is an outcome (which IS holding the process).&nbsp;All other roles might have an opinion about&nbsp;the particular candidates.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some signals, that the facilitator does not really get involved in politics for that matter:</p><p>- selecting blindly/randomly, meaning that he does not include any consideration about who is best. Why don't you just flip a coin?</p><p>- referring to outside factors that he has no influence on, as mentioned in (ii) or (iii).&nbsp;</p><p>I think it's pretty straightforward that the Facilitator has the last word here.&nbsp;</p></dd>
