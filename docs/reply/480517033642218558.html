<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thank you for the insights! I think you could drop any reasonable retrospective process into the sticky note portion of the process. I think the main thing is that you have a checkin, a closing, some sort of tension/data gathering process, and make sure that all solutions are funneled into clearly stated and clearly owned projects and actions (or action to bring a tension). I have seen lack of engagement when the team felt like the retrospective&nbsp;didn't lead to any concrete changes, and I think tying it back to Holacracy makes the meetings more engaging because it makes the value more obvious.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think a variety of processes might raise different types of data, so that might also be a good reason to change up the process type.&nbsp;We probably haven't run this process with enough consistency to see fatigue with it, but I do think that Holacracy really makes it more engaging for us in the GlassFrog circle.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do you have any other processes that might be useful, especially for folks who don't use agile, but want to use a retrospective style meeting to help a team get in touch with their tensions?&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>  </div>
