  <dd><p>Carrie,</p><p>In my example, we instituted a Policy at the GCC to restrict team members in certain cases from filling more than x-number of roles. &nbsp;The Policy was enacted based on a tension created around resource allocation and certain team members ability to fully energize their primary (core roles).</p><p>The important thing to consider, from my perspective, is that in our case, the Governance was tension-driven. &nbsp;</p><p>If the old managers are restricting circle assignment - which would require Governance - based solely&nbsp;on their desire to control &nbsp;people (i.e not based in a Tension), then the Policy which would be required to restrict such assignments would not stand testing outlined in Para. 3.2.3.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
