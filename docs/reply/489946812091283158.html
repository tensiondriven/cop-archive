  <dd><p>Hi Fred,</p><p>I don't understand your issue very clearly.</p><p>From my perspective, important point is to get a starting proposal, even a few words, to process the tension. So you can apply the IDM process. Through clarifying questions and reactions round, proposer will be able to get a lot of informations about his/her original issue. After that, he/her might clarify tension and amend proposal, or drop the proposal waiting for more maturation.</p><p>Hope that helps,<br />Jean-Michel</p></dd>
