  <dd><p>Hi Marco,</p><p>As a general rule, I will ask each role-filler to provide an update on their projects and remind them that the update should be restricted to any changes or updates since our last&nbsp;Tactical meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Early in our practice, I would read each project and ask the role-filler if there were any updates. &nbsp;This practice helped draw attention to each of the individual projects and helped avoid the "no updates on any of my projects" response, which doesn't really allow enough time for the group sense and respond to tensions around the role and or project list.</p><p>I do not skip waiting for or completed projects (I do ask if the completed project can be archived).</p><p>- Dennis&nbsp;</p></dd>
