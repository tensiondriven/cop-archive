  <dd><p>Hmm - that's a good question Ivan. I think I see it as the values which we as an organisation enact in the world i.e. what do we stand for or what do we stand up for<br /><br />In a way this is part of our business model though actually for me&nbsp;personally using the word 'business model' doesn't quite fit either.&nbsp;</p><p>As lead link of the GCC I can set the overall purpose of the organisation. But as lead link of the GCC I need to know in what context we are carrying out that purpose and so far as I can see the values of the organisation are the context i.e. because we are 'us' we are carrying out our purpose in this kind of way</p></dd>
