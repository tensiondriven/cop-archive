  <dd><p>Hi Sherrie and welcome! &nbsp;</p><p>Sorry you didn't get any response. I know Steve Starkey used to work with a company using Holacracy in Chicago, and last time I heard he was still in that area. You can try connecting with him <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sstarkey" target="_blank">via LinkedIn</a>. Good luck!</p><p>PS: I'm going to move your topic in the "Members Around the World" forum as it's more about connecting with others than practice questions.&nbsp;</p></dd>
