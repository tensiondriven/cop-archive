  <dd><p>[@mention:547933710129853822], In a way what u say also makes sense. Its about communicating and not managing. Maybe its about how the different parts or roles of the project who are interdependent may not be communicating with each other. Maybe we can see this as a series of steps and one step does its work it passes the info the next person who needs to take it up. I am getting clarity,&nbsp;we need to create a role&nbsp;a role called garden visualiser, who imagines the garden and passes the needs to different people, the person doesnot manage the other people how they work but make requests to them in their different role like a fabircator of beds, or the one who can purchases the manure and seeds, work with the planter who brings the plants needed from the nursery. we can create this role and see how it works.&nbsp;</p><p>thanks for ur sharing.&nbsp;</p></dd>
