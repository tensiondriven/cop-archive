  <dd><p>Sure, it's a software that aims to cover all features needed to practice Holacracy such as GlassFrog does? It has been developed by TalkSpirit, a start-up based in France that has implemented Holacracy coached by iGi Partners, two years ago. This software don't have yet the same level as GlassFrog - the gap should be covered soon.</p></dd>
