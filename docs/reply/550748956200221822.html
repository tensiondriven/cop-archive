  <dd><p>Hey Keith - You're right, you definitely wouldn't want to try asking the Facilitator to test during Clarifying Questions. &nbsp;Instead, you would just ask the test questions yourself, as your own clarifying questions. &nbsp;If the answers prove the proposal isn't valid, the Facilitator has a duty to step in at that point and discard the proposal.</p></dd>
