  <dd><p>Cobus,</p><p>I don't mind that the burden is on the facilitator, but I do wish that the tiebreaking process provided fewer options.&nbsp; Even if the facilitator can do it by any of those methods, her selection of a particular method will in most cases have an effect on the ultimate proposal because he knows the results.&nbsp; I think ideally there should be a hierarchy of tiebreaking procedures, so that you break the tie by means of method 1 if possible, then method 2, then method 3, then random if none of the above.&nbsp; Another way to do it would just be to go straight to blind selection.</p><p>Kevin</p></dd>
