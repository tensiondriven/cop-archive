  <dd><p>Shammi, I will also be in New York for Holacracy Training in April on the same dates. My organization Purely Poultry has been powered by Holacracy for 2.5 years. My team is all remote and we work from our homes in Wisconsin. I do not believe that you coming to Wisconsin would be very beneficial but I am looking forward to spending some time with you while we are in New York.&nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/1184" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/1184</a></p></dd>
