  <dd><p>Sam, yes the do - and I'm generally inquiring on forums in support of other partners in role as in-house coach. I don't sit in any of our finance-related roles with the bulk of my roles living in the other side of the infrastructure realm of administration &amp; implementation.</p><p>BUT I know that some of these financial controls issues were handled reasonably well in our previous board of directors / bylaws structure. In many ways we're back to square one with things as bureacratic as the financial controls and other seeming functional conflicts of annual budget vs lead link making resource allocation.</p><p>Fun, fun, fun.</p></dd>
