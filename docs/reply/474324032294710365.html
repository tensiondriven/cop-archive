  <dd><p>Hey Keith - I like where you're going with this. &nbsp;I find there's something super powerful in a&nbsp;short, quick, colloquial question here though, so&nbsp;I'd worry "What do you want to have happen?" may be a bit too verbally long/cumbersome to have the needed punch - but curious what you find from experimenting. &nbsp;As a potential alternative, maybe experiment with "What would you like?"...?</p></dd>
