  <dd><p>Hi Harald,</p><p>I forgot to mention, in the GlassFrog circle, we also have Daily Standup meetings with just the developers to coordinate&nbsp;the developer's work:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting</a></a>. These are still operational (as opposed to governance meetings), and are meant to be short (maybe 10-15 minutes). Maybe something like that would be&nbsp;useful for your purpose - maybe daily, or even a couple of times a week. I still bring topics&nbsp;to the Tactical Meetings, but the Tactical meeting&nbsp;doesn't have to fill every need, it is just a matter of parsing out the different things you need. &nbsp;</p></dd>
