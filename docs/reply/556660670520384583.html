  <dd><p>[@mention:491495232183315418], thank you for the answer! Believe, I clearly understand your point of view.</p><p>You've told:</p><p><em><span style="background-color: #d8d8d8;">My understanding of this App is just a way of doing this allocation by creating a more tangible scale on the attention partners should put&nbsp;while&nbsp;energizing a role. So for instance the LL allocates 20 Attention Points to Role A. So Partner X energizing role A should not&nbsp;dedicate more than 20% of his focus to it (my assumption here would be that 100 AP = 1 FTE).</span></em></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I would like to disagree with you. LL may understand how much time the Partner needs to spend on each Role, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but one Partner is involved in different Circles with different LLs</span>, you see? LL can not see the picture from the view of a Partner. I would even say that the LL acts as a manager of the Partner, because he/she says to the Partner how long he/she has to accomplish the Role.<br /></span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Are you sure, that you understand Attention Points right?</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I think, I have better way to organise attention of the partners onto the Projects and Next Actions.</span></span> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The idea is each partner of the company has own Kanban board, where all his/her Next Actions and Projects are located <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the prioritised way</span></span>. All means the projects from all Roles the partner holds.</p><p>The prioritisation of the Next Actions and Projects is done according to some coefficient. For example, <u>the ratio of the ‘percentage of already done tasks (in hours)’ to the ‘percentage of already spent time (in hours)’</u>. It requires each project and next action to have:</p><ul><li>Defined start date;</li><li>Defined deadline;</li><li>Either estimated time for each task of the project (or next action) or automatically calculated average time for one task from the experience.</li></ul><p><span style="color: #a5a5a5;">*Task means either a Next Action or one of actions in a Project.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Actually, do you know how the Attention Points are used by H1? Maybe we both understand them wrong. For now I still see no need in them.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Kind regards,<br />Georgiy.</span></p></dd>
