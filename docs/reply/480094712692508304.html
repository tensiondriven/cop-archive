  <dd><p>We don't do enough but this is our checklist:&nbsp;<a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/roles/52013/role_notes/2951" target="_blank">https://glassfrog.holacracy.or...2013/role_notes/2951</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, as part of the hiring process top candidates observe a tactical meeting and are informed that we practice Holacracy. Part of the candidate evaluation is whether they did any research on their own and ask questions during the interviews. So, by the time they come in they have some level of awareness and basic understanding.</p><p>We make self-paced learning resources available. We also host bi-weekly Holacracy learning sessions for anyone interested.&nbsp;</p><p>I would say that most of our training is immersion training; learn by doing and following the modeled behaviors.</p><p>I don't believe this will scale. I think some combination of regular learning sessions and self-paced materials would be best. Ah, to dream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
