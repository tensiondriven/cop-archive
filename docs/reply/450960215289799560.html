  <dd><p><a href="http://www.evolvingorganisation.com" target="_blank">Evolving Organisation</a> has no&nbsp;Lead Link of our anchor circle, which is called the Purpose Circle. This circle has a <strong>Role Assignments</strong> policy which says '<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><em>In the absence of a Lead Link, assignments to roles are made through the Integrative Election Process</em>.' The sub-circle of&nbsp;the Purpose Circle, called the Evolving Circle has a&nbsp;Lead Link. In this circle, some of the default functions of the Lead Link are starting to be distributed to other roles.&nbsp;You can see our Glass Frog&nbsp;records <a href="https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/organizations/194" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">In terms of reasons for doing this, we did it&nbsp;to experiment with&nbsp;a blending of integrative election choosing a Lead Link with a Lead Link with some&nbsp;</span>hierarchal<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&nbsp;functions, which are being delegated,&nbsp;and so far its working fine for us. The&nbsp;Holacracy Self-Organisation Maturity Map charts the later levels of maturity of Holacracy practice&nbsp;around&nbsp;Lead Links as:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><strong>Level 3- Enhances Practice:</strong> '<em>There are some constraints on&nbsp;Lead Link autocratic authority captured in&nbsp;Governance; or authorities of&nbsp;Lead Link are sometimes delegated to other roles</em>."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"><strong>Level 4- Evolving Practice:</strong> &nbsp;<em>'The&nbsp;organisation has processes that replace many&nbsp;Lead Link authorities with effective, distributed, peer-to-peer methods, encoded transparently in&nbsp;Governance'.&nbsp;</em></span></p></dd>
