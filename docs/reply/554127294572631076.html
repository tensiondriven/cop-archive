  <dd><p>Xavier,</p><p>Yes, I would coach people as such: Is it right to say that no policy can override the constitution unless specified in the constitution itself ?</p><p>Only the ratifiers have the authority to make constitutional amendments as Margaux points out. In most organizations the anchor circle is not the ratifier. It is a really bad idea to make amendments until there is a stable, mature practice. You can do a governance audit, explore the reasons for the desire to "work around" the constitution and coach for a constitutional approach to resolving tensions.</p></dd>
