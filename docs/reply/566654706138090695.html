  <dd><p>Hum.. curious about the tension behind. Why would someone within your Circle A-1 add an accountability for “Answering inbound emails while looping in +WidgetDesign”. What role IN THE CIRCLE fills the tension? Is it an accountability on the circle that the Lead Link is breaking down?</p><p>If it is the second, it means that in the Super-Circle they choose to refer to the role within the circle. It is not NVGO (Non Valid Governance Output). Sometimes it makes sense. Usually, we would rather respect the circle membranes and refer to the circle names only because they are like black boxes, we can't see inside.</p><p>I recommend respecting the black boxes.</p></dd>
