  <dd><p>If Next-Actions are constitutionally approached, then they'll be kept in one's trusted system. With tensions, it's easy enough to drop the link to your trusted digital system (e.g., a Google Doc, a to do manager, even folders in your email system or specific emails) and to log the Next-Acton(s) in it. What would be nice is if a similar text box were included for projects, so that the tracking document or system could be linked directly to the project summary. In the same way that the constitution is an operating system that users augment with plugin apps, GlassFrog doesn't have to do everything as long as it allows users to plug their preferred/trusted systems into it. In this way, GlassFrog will be more reflective of and supportive of the constitution that it helps us more naturally use.</p></dd>
