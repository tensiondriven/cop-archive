  <dd><p>Hi, Bernard:</p><p>Thanks a lot for the example.</p><p>So, we can add any accountabilities to the Cross Link role, just like with any other role, including, say, to represent our circle in the linked entity and resolve our problems there, as long as the role filler for the Cross Link role does not see any harm in doing so, and even then, we'll go to integration and find the best solution there. Cool !</p><p>I've seen in github the suggestion to just have rep links as opposed to having different kinds of links. Can you add accountabilities to Rep Links, like you can with Cross Links ?</p><p>Dien.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
