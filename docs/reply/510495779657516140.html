  <dd><p>@Ruben, in my understanding, your objection is invalid because you're trying to anticipate what <strong>might</strong> happen. If the Proposal is accepted, then <strong>there</strong> <strong>might</strong> <strong>be</strong> an overlap or&nbsp;confusion about who you should ask. Anyway, in my opinion this confusion won't hurt, because both roles will be accountable, and you can just choose one...</p><p>Also, for&nbsp;me the proposal seems to be "safe enough to try" and you can adapt later once you get more data. If I were the facilitator I would invalidate your objection...&nbsp;</p><p>Hope it helps.</p></dd>
