  <dd><p>I don't believe there's anything in the Constitution that would empower&nbsp;a lead link to say "spend no more than half your time in this role" and expect that to be a hard limit&nbsp;that someone absolutely must&nbsp;adhere to, in the same way the lead link&nbsp;could if they had a budget to allocate and said&nbsp;"spend no more than $x in this role".</p><p>That's because&nbsp;"disposing of assets" (e.g. spending money)&nbsp;is limited&nbsp;by ยง2.1.3, which applies a hard and clear&nbsp;limit - and even Individual Action has to honor it, per ยง4.3.1. &nbsp;I wouldn't&nbsp;interpret&nbsp;allocating time/attention to a role as "disposing of assets", so there is no inherent restriction around it in the same way there is around spending cash or getting rid of organizational property.</p><p>However, the lead link can specify priorities and expect people will use their judgment on how to reasonably integrate them, per the duty of all circle members in ยง4.1.3(c). &nbsp;So the lead link could say "prioritize these two roles equally" and expect the person to integrate that prioritization and put a roughly similar amount of time into each role, at least on average. &nbsp;But that doesn't necessarily mean they won't at times put one role ahead of the other, or go beyond 50% to one&nbsp;role for awhile, because it's still up to the person to figure out how to incorporate that prioritization given their own local knowledge of their local context.</p><p>So, this&nbsp;is still a tool a&nbsp;Lead Link can use to achieve some intended balancing of time between roles: clarify the priorities, and expect people to figure out how to integrate them. &nbsp;But that's a different level of "hard and clear&nbsp;limit" than&nbsp;applies in the case of spending money (or disposing of assets of any kind), where it's not left to best judgment on how to integrate in&nbsp;a local&nbsp;context - it's simply a hard limit. &nbsp;(Though, you can always create a policy that enacts a hard limit for time allocation, if that's useful/needed to address tensions.)</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
