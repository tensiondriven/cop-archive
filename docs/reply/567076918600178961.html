  <dd><p>Hi Ulrich</p><p>I would love&nbsp;to know what do you see in the LL role that leads you to this conclusion? <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I think there a whole range of ways of performing the LL role from very open/agile, to very directive/normal boss.</p><p>I think that LL can be a lot like Product Owner - who defines priorities, and defines who is and isn't in the team. I don't really see the LL as 'pushing' work - in fact they get to push work less than a Product Owner, who controls what goes into the Backlog.</p><p>Thanks, Andrew&nbsp;</p></dd>
