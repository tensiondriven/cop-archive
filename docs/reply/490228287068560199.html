  <dd><p>Hi Margaux,&nbsp;</p><p>Brian gave an example like&nbsp;like this at the Seattle PCT yesterday. He described a scenario where the proposal was to add&nbsp;an additional accountability to a role and the Lead Link objected because it would make the role impossible to fill due to the combination of skill sets that would be required. At least for that scenario he considered it to be a valid objection from the Lead Link.</p><p>-Eric</p></dd>
