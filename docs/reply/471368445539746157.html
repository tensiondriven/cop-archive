  <dd><p>Hi Nick - I have a lot of thoughts on that - but they're both too many and too nuanced&nbsp;to convey effectively in writing here. &nbsp;I'm scheduled to host one of our coach's office hours soon; if you'd like to join, perhaps we can chat about it real-time? &nbsp;I bet the topic and some distinctions I could offer around it would be really useful for others too.</p><p>Of course, don't let me stop dialog from happening in this thread here too in the meantime, if anyone has thoughts to share!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
