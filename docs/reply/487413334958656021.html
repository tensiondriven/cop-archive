  <dd><p>Technically, only admins can add “global checklist” and “global metrics” (it applies for all the circles of the organization).&nbsp;</p><p>Each person can add checklist items in his/her roles but if you want to add it on another role you're not assigned to, you need to ask that role to add it.</p><p>The secretary can modify that but only because it could make sense to do that in a middle of a meeting - in the constitution there is nothing special for the secretary. And, of course, admins can do that as well.</p></dd>
