  <dd><p>It is true, at maturity level 5 Holacracy does not provide that it is necessary to dismiss people, because it assumes that a person who does not want to participate in the purpose of the organization finds another way independently. In my experience, it is not always possible to convince employees of a company to contribute with their talents to the purpose of the organization; this assumes the presence of widespread leadership, which is usually not present when you move to Holacracy (at maturity level 1). In my experience, people who have not wanted or been able to take on roles aligned with their talent have simply resigned over time.</p></dd>
