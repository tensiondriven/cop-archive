<p>Ahh Oliver, I got a correction from Olivier Compagne about this issue. we should <strong>not&nbsp;</strong>do that because, according to the constitution, Partners already have duties that they must adhere to such as manifesting the organizations purpose being one of them among others. For my purposes, I want to see where the partner can offer proposals and such if they feel tension and the constitution says they can do so. Now, when it comes to helping another role such as a partner, this is where they will hit an objection through the testing objections regardless. This was my concern partners offering proposals to help another role is just as wrong if one role tries to help another role.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it states in the constitution, finally, a proposal is always valid regardless of the preceding criteria if it is made solely to help evolve the Circle’s Governance to more clearly reflect activity that is already happening, or to trigger a new election for any Elected Role." So regardless of where it comes from, this is paramount.&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder how others feel about this? Am I on track? lol.</p>  </div>
