  <dd><p>This question is complex so I am not going to cover it all but here are some questions to begin with:</p><p>First question: what is the agreement between coworkers and the organization? Is their something explicite like a work contract or something?</p><p>Then, second question:&nbsp;what role is dealing with partner issues and this type of contracts? Do you have a role for that? If answer is no, then you must define it in governance.</p></dd>
