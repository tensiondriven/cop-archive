  <dd><ul><li><strong>Approach</strong>: circle Lead Links request budget per project from a role Budgets &amp; Resources that we created because we felt the general fall back to the super circle LL was too implicit / unclear. On top of that there are some predefined / rolling budgets</li><li><strong>Tools</strong>: Some are documented in Asana under the relevant projects, some are in our Google Apps sheets coupled with the rest of our forecasting</li><li><strong>Tensions</strong>: none since they would be solved immediately in governance <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="noBorder" /> (which most circles do weekly here). There has been tension about regularly requesting budgets, fixed by predefining them. I think we could do a better job of coupling budgets to roles, this is currently partly implicit.</li><li><strong>Toolset</strong>: can you give an example, not sure I understand the question.</li></ul></dd>
