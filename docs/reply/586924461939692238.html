  <dd><p>[@mention:476716727608952329] &nbsp;Tks for your questions. I am aware&nbsp;it sounds like I a want to design something. However we have monitored the situation now for a few months, and the Lead Links/coordinators do not feel a tension on the boundary issues, but I as a coach do feel it.&nbsp;The other tension&nbsp;is that the current circle structure does not stimulate role/soul differentiation, it's like teams of persons with another name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>@chris Thanks a lot for your input. This is&nbsp;the level of specificity that I was looking for. Now the next step for me is&nbsp;to process this tension.</p><p>As for the number 7 is concerned, not aware of any requisite requirement there. They are physically sitting together on desk islands, so maybe that is it. Would be interesting though to see&nbsp;if that number will change if the circle structure changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
