  <dd><p>Hi,</p><p>Old topic, but didn't want to add a new one with exact same name.</p><p>I'm confused. I'm actually reasoning in the opposite way of Paul : I would only override the constitution when it's allowed by the constitution itself (so it's not really overruling then :-)) : so basically when it's written "unless alternate terms are defined in the Policy" or equivalent. I would not touch anything else.</p><p>So is it right to say that no policy can override the constitution unless specified in the constitution itself ? Or is it more subtle ? And if so, what are the exact rules ?</p><p>About Lisi initial issue, I might have done differently : As the LL or RL can invite a partner outside of&nbsp;the circle to attend the governance meeting, that this partner, for the time being, becomes core member (art 3.3.1), the partner becomes then eligible for the election.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
