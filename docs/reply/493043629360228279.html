<p>And to add to this,&nbsp;I'd like to apply this thinking to the issue of a policy for the 'Auto-accept time limit' for asynchronous&nbsp;Governance proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>If a GCC creates a policy for the auto-accept time limit to be say 5 days, then does this time limit then automatically apply to all sub-circles of the GCC or not?&nbsp;</p><p>According to the above, if a domain of 'Auto-accept time-limit' was created and delegated from the Anchor Circle and a policy for 5 days created, then this would apply to all circles, regardless of which circle the domain and its policy sits in.&nbsp;</p><p>But if this domain isn't delegated in this way, and the policy applies only to the default 'All functions &amp; activities within the Circle' domain, then the policy obviously doesn't apply upwards to super-circles, but there is a question of whether it applies downwards to all sub-circles of the circle its created in?&nbsp;</p><p>This relates to&nbsp;Andrea's question above about whether the default 'All functions and activities within the Circle' is a 'fully-fledged domain' or not, and&nbsp;I'm not sure whether this query&nbsp;I have here is because of a gap in my understanding or a gap in the constitution not providing clarity on this issue?&nbsp;</p><p>So if anyone else has any clarity on this issue then&nbsp;I'd appreciate it as this is a live issue for a client right now, thanks!</p>  </div>
