  <dd><p>Thank you Paul for clarifying the “why”. Bernard Marie and I are very “why” focused so it was indeed a bit odd for us not to see it on top of your document <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>I love your experiment and of course, I am a bit doubtful because it is new but I am very open-minded to see how it goes and maybe&nbsp;it will be a great value to catalyze&nbsp;the PowerShift in companies practicing Holacracy (which is, by the way, our purpose so we are very interested by your experiment).</p><p>One thought I have here is what we've described in our comic book when talking about the Lead Link role (<a href="http://igipartners.com/en/read-holacracy-comic-book-free#page-152-153" target="_blank">http://igipartners.com/en/read...ok-free#page-152-153</a>): the two links (up-&gt;down and bottom-&gt;up) allows to have two different focuses/directions: the Rep&nbsp;Link seizes the tension from the Sub-Circle and bring it up to the Super-Circle and the Lead Link brings tensions from the Super-Circle to the Sub-Circle to differentiate the work. If the Rep Link does both, we might lose a perspective and it might create&nbsp;a schizophrenia if only one person has to deal with both perspectives (the Super-Circle and the Sub-Circle one). Again, this is pure speculation based on what the manager was doing and didn't work. Though in your Holacracy Circle I bet you didn't have a manager before so t might be easier.</p><p>Please keep me posted on the evolution of this! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
