  <dd><p>Thank you Paul for clarifying the “why”.

If the Rep Link does both, we might lose a perspective and it might create&nbsp;a schizophrenia if only one person has to deal with both perspectives (the Super-Circle and the Sub-Circle one). Again, this is pure speculation based on what the manager was doing and didn't work. Though in your Holacracy Circle I bet you didn't have a manager before so t might be easier.</p><p>Please keep me posted on the evolution of this! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
