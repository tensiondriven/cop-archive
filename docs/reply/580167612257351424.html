  <dd><p>[@mention:544274267239861666]&nbsp;Thanks for this post, it's a great reflection to have and kudos for seeking help when you're starting to feel stuck, vs. just staying stuck!</p><p>I can share that I've experienced some of that at HolacracyOne, and I've seen that happen in client organizations I've worked with. Most of the time, in client organizations, it's been the result of a misapplication of Holacracy itself — they were running with Holacracy&nbsp;at a fairly "shallow" level, and really needed to&nbsp;increase the maturity of their practice. I mention that here because I've seen that especially in orgs where only a couple people have been to a training, or have been exposed to professional help in some way (training, consulting, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>I've seen that happen at times at HolacracyOne due to the lack of specific "business process app" that worked with Holacracy. For example compensation and hiring and firing. It's difficult to keep the old ways of setting compensations when you run with Holacracy because people don't have just "one job" but several roles. So Holacracy creates a need for a new way of dealing with compensations.&nbsp;</p><p>At HolacracyOne, we've had to design our own Holacracy apps to address these needs. Right now the strongest need we have (in my opinion) is a better way to handle time allocation/prioritization at a more granular level. It's&nbsp;very useful to set overall strategies for the organization or specific circles, but it doesn't address the need to clarify priorities at a micro level. So that's something we're working on developing.</p><p>It's difficult to help you without knowing the specifics and the context of your organization. For example, what do you mean by being stuck? stuck where? what's not working? etc.<br />Have you had any professional help from experts? If not, I'd suggest that as a good next step. They would probably be able to identify some key challenges to work on.&nbsp;</p></dd>
