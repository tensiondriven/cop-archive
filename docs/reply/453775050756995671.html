  <dd><p>In that case, then may be a better approach to allow Governance to drive changes if there are roles in the new circle that are currently filled and being operationalized. Just because you can change the structure that way doesn't mean it is the best way. Holding an initial Governance meeting with the existing team could drive more engagement rather than Lead Link structuring. Let us know what happens!</p></dd>
