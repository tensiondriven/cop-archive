  <dd><p>Xavier, I think you are asking about how to assign role-fillers when there is no Lead Link to the circle? &nbsp;The Secretary can do this in GlassFrog (assuming your organization has a policy that they may do so for the circle without a Lead Link). &nbsp;Further, I am understanding that you'd like anyone in the circle to be able to do this asynchronously? &nbsp;To get more details of your request this would be better to track this via <a href="mailto:support@glassfrog.com">support@glassfrog.com</a></p></dd>
