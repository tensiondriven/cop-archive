We glanced through the Constitution and did not find specifics. We partly concluded, partly recalled from HPT that this&nbsp;true when the Proposer has additional&nbsp;roles than the one that is presenting the proposal (which is&nbsp;often true). This&nbsp;is beneficial two-fold. On one hand it reminds the Proposer of a larger context of other roles he might have missed. On the other hand it reinforces the "people are not roles" principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>I&nbsp;know it sounds weird to ask the proposer if he has objections (even if he does not have other roles),&nbsp;however, I found&nbsp;useful to say that it is a way to change your own mind. That posture allowed to have a couple of times the Proposer objecting after having heard other objections that triggered other thoughts. Everyone appreciated.</p><p>In any&nbsp;case, I agree with you that the option of objecting to their own proposals should be further clarified in the Constitution.</p>  </div>
