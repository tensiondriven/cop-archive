  <dd><p>Hi Fajar,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are a 4 people-size company and it works just well. We do lots of work and external people often think we are more than that.</p><p>Holacracy will certainly bring a lot of value, making everything explicit.</p><p>I would suggest to start with only one circle and a couple of roles, no more. Otherwise, it will be overwhelmed.</p><p>Would love to hear your feedback once implemented.</p></dd>
