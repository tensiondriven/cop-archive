  <dd><p>Hey,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many thoughts on that:</p><p>1/ “Being available” is not an on going activity, therefor not a valid accountability - you could object NVGO</p><p>2/ A role is always available - the person filling the role may not</p><p>In your specific case, I guess the tension is to make sure that&nbsp;there is always someone filling the Engineer role. In this case, if you are the Lead Link, you can assign this role to multiple persons with different focus - you are still constrained by the work agreement because it is a legal document. If as a role filler you need it, then I would suggest creating a policy like “There must always be someone filling the engineer role so the service doesn't stop” (not proper I am sure but you can get the sense).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a Facilitator though, you can't judge objections.
