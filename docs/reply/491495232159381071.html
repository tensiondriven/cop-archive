  <dd><p>Hey Paul - I read your responses; I have many thoughts, though I'm not clear what you're looking for&nbsp;here at this point, if anything? &nbsp;I'm sensing that my challenging or debating your conclusions&nbsp;is probably not what you're after, and probably&nbsp;unlikely to&nbsp;add&nbsp;much&nbsp;value. &nbsp;If there is something that you're&nbsp;looking for from me or&nbsp;would find valuable, in order for me to serve you best, I'd&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;that you&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solonline.org/?page=Tool_InquiryAdvocacy" target="_blank">balance more inquiry into your always-excellent advocacy</a>. &nbsp;That will&nbsp;give me more&nbsp;openings where I can share insights appropriately, and allow me to focus my coaching&nbsp;so it's&nbsp;more&nbsp;aligned with what you're looking for and&nbsp;serves&nbsp;Zappos most&nbsp;effectively.</p></dd>
