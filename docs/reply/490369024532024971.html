  <dd><p>Interesting! Does "<em>distributed all authorities across the Circle to all Circle Members</em>" mean that you've governed all accountabilities that the LL normally has, to other (or all??) circle roles? Could you clarify, maybe by showing those accountabilities and the roles that currently hold them?</p><p>Also, what kind of tensions made this happen? I don't see a "problem" with the LL role, although we have added policies around it to make things more specific.</p></dd>
