  <dd><p>No nothing is stored. But one of the responsibilities for the Facilitator is to manage (must attempt) that all items are handled within the defined time for the meeting (art 4.2.2.(e)).</p><p>If this is not working out then the Facilitator can ask if people want to stay longer to finish the last items (no obligation) or ask the Agenda item owners to take the Tension with them and either process it outside of the meeting or put it on the agenda in the next Tactical meeting (or not if no longer relevant or has been solved).</p></dd>
