  <dd><p>Hey Tiziano,</p><p>I underline the points you are making (about invalidity), but have not quite got your&nbsp;underlying question in the starting post (nor can find any in your post ;-).</p><p>I can see different questions, such as: 1) what is the technically correct way/answer re objections in case of access request?&nbsp;2) what do I do as (what role?) if someone is not willing to grant access even if the objections are not valid? 3) or: what to do when ego-driven behavior shows up and people don't play by the rules or try to outsmart the system by stubbornly staying with their perspective only.</p><p>If it is about further pathways to process that, you are not dependent on the valid/invalid objection question.</p><p>1) Outreach&nbsp;could think of using governance to withdraw the domain from that role, if outreach could provide real examples how this harms the circle. You could&nbsp;make it part of the circle and add a policy how access is constrained for example to integrate possibly occuring objections of communication role.&nbsp;</p><p>2) additionally, probably not the preferred option but still a pathway:&nbsp;if a role-filler continuously shows stubborn behavior pitch the lead link to check role-fit. If it is about people fighting the rules of the game a more in-depth coaching or conversation seems&nbsp;also helpful&nbsp;IMHO (by whatever role holds accountabilities for that).&nbsp;</p><p>Curious, what specifically is of interest to you.</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
