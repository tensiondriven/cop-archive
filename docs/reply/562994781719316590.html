  <dd><p>Any core circle member can request another core circle member to attend a specific instance of a recurring meeting to process a tension (that's my reading of 4.1.3). Duty of prioritisation than applies.</p><p>As far as I can see, there's nothing in the constitution to stop you having 'surrogates' for roles (and agreeing how that happens may be useful under other circumstances too - illness, holiday cover etc). In Governance "a Proposal may alternatively help another Circle Member better express one of that personâ€™s Roles in the Circle, but only if that person has granted the Proposer permission to represent that Role" &nbsp;- so my inclination would be to apply the same spirit in Tactical. But you can of course do anything <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p></dd>
