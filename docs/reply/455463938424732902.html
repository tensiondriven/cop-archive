It focus's on Articles 1 and 4 of the constitution as I believe they are the most important to expose people filling roles to. The course is a walk through of those sections and some activities exercises as I am also a GTD trainer and coach I of course orientate it towards GTD practice as well with practical examples this I have found really focus's people on there duties and responsibilities as role fillers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think articles 2 and 3 are really learned via the practice and involvement of tactical and governance meetings its not about a deep understand of the rules its about learning the practice within the context of the rules just like monopoly its through playing the game and referring to the rules when a issue arises that we get the best learnings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just my 2 cents</p><p>Stephan</p></blockquote></div><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
