  <dd><p>No updates in the Dutch context, that I'm aware of.</p><p>This (Dutch) page details the previous exemptions from Dutch worker representation law that have been made, based on sociocracy:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ser.nl/nl/taken/orenmedezeggenschap/ontheffingorplicht.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.ser.nl/nl/taken/or...heffingorplicht.aspx</a></p><p>Again, I'm confident we could make a strong case why Holacracy ticks those same boxes at least as good or better. All we're waiting for is the first organization who is willing to invest some time and energy to prove this point and work with the SER.</p><p>Alternatively, you could do what others have outlined above and just map the current reality of a work(er) representation council ("Ondernemingsraad") with the language of Holacracy, i.e. using circles, roles, and policies.</p><p>My colleagues and I would be happy to help do either of those two things!</p></dd>
