  <dd><p>Gotcha Fred, definitely not Facilitator's place to judge! &nbsp;But it's hard to imagine a valid proposal that will achieve the effect of enforcing a&nbsp;language change. &nbsp;I mean, you can't govern people (only roles), so you can't demand people stop saying a word. &nbsp;You could change the word in the Constitution itself that the company has adopted, but that would take a Ratifier-level constitutional amendment; and even then it's no guarantee people won't still say "tension". &nbsp;You could create an accountability on some role for defining standard terms, sure - but that's still no guarantee people won't say "tension", and they'd have really good reason to as long as the Constitution used the word, whatever that role might decree...</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>- Brian</p></dd>
