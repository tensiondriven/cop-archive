  <dd><p>Thanks for your question&nbsp;[@mention:523162737680436711]&nbsp;and&nbsp;it’s good to see peer support in preparing for the&nbsp;Tactical Assessment!</p><p>This is just a quick note to let you know that&nbsp;I am processing your request and will respond here as soon as&nbsp;I can.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge we are facing is that it’s not realistic for people to have weeks to pour over GlassFrog data for a meeting they are about to facilitate with a new group because in reality a coach would rarely have this opportunity, and we are trying to make&nbsp;assessment as close to real-life conditions as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The test is based on “how would an experienced coach handle this situation?”; and not having much time to prepare is realistic.</p></dd>
