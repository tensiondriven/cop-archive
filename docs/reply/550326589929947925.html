<p>[@mention:491354494783059362]&nbsp;it would be useful to look into the specifics of the situation to be able to make concrete recommendations.</p><p>But from what you're describing, it seems to me that the mechanisms of Holacracy (specifically&nbsp;the governance process) should be enough, if used correctly, to address these issues.</p><p>The Lead Link of the Product Owners circle could very well propose a change in the governance of this circle to standardize around a specific methodology, and the product owners would be bound by this methodology if the proposal was accepted. Of course they may raise "Objections" to the proposal, which would be an&nbsp;opportunity to integrate them in the "Integration" phase of the process; this is where the magic happens.</p><p>We&nbsp;might, for example, discover that parts of the reason the product owners don't like the new methodology are just a personal preference for the status-quo (which would likely not be valid Objections, and would therefore be dismissed), while parts of it are actually good reasons to take into&nbsp;account for the sake of the organization (which would be valid Objections, and would need to be integrated before the proposal is adopted).&nbsp;</p><p>Of course it's easier said than done. If the participants are new to Holacracy, it will take an experienced Facilitator or coach to facilitate getting&nbsp;to that output.&nbsp;</p>  </div>
