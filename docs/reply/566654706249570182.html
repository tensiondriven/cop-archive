  <dd><p>I think you'd want a domain to restrict who defines the official process for exiting the company, but other than that...leave out the whole notion of trying to restrict "advising." It sounds like a horrible idea to restrict advice; where does it stop? Why not restrict sharing opinions or information that might lead someone to consider leaving?&nbsp;</p><p>There are very good reasons why someone might need to leave a circle or the company, restricting talking about it doesn't make those situations less likely, it just means you're less likely to know about them and make conscious decisions about them.&nbsp;</p></dd>
