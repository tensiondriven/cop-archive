  <dd><p>Thanks for feedback.<br />I thought that a whole project holder that only coordinate the other roles was not in line with holacracy principles and practices.<br />I thought that this project holder role could be a bottleneck and that could create something like a manager.<br />but from your answers I learned that this is not true and that is more important the clarity.<br /><br />thanks</p><p>&nbsp; Giuseppe</p></dd>
