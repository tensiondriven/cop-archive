  <dd><p>Hi Olivier,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for sharing, I like it a lot.</p><p>I think in your proposer's guideline “State your tension clearly, or explain why you're unclear on it”, I would add: tension=be as specific as you can and bring as many specific cases/examples as you can to illustrate it - remember a tension is a concrete situation that occurred. The more we have real grounded example, the easier it is to get to a starting proposal because we want to address the minimum sufficient to fix&nbsp;the specific issue.</p></dd>
