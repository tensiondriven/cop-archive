  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Egill Runar Vidarsson posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>[@mention:450819477777465353]:&nbsp;my primary interest at this point is to observe whether&nbsp;players of “Little Bookcase Publications”&nbsp;v.3.0 start to understand the basic fundamentals of Holacracy via gameplay&nbsp;– i.e. how governance (roles, accountabilities) affects operations (projects, events, …) and vice versa. The secondary aim is to observe whether the game-mechanics are balanced enough to allow for a fun and engaging game. And …</p><p>In the meantime, please check out the&nbsp;<em>4. Findings</em> and <em>5. Conclusion</em> sections in the <a href="http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1623/1/Vidarsson_Egill_2017_MDes_DigitalFutures_LearningHolacracyThroughPlay.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Learning Holacracy Fundamentals Through Play thesis">thesis document</a>&nbsp;for more details regarding benefits and limitations of v.3.0 of the game, as well as <em>Appendix E</em> and <em>Appendix F</em>. This, I think, will help you to get acquainted with the game as “moderators” before&nbsp;running the game as it can be&nbsp;quite slow and sometimes frustrating if all players are learning a game at the same time.</p><p>For credit, I would greatly&nbsp;appreciate that&nbsp;you point your participants and colleagues to my portfolio (<a href="http://www.egillrunar.com/little-bookcase-publications/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="An introductory board game to Holacracy fundamentals">http://www.egillrunar.com/litt...okcase-publications/</a>).</p><p>I’ll be in touch. <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p></div></blockquote><p>[@mention:528792613988609658], thank you for bringing your project to this point. I looked at your webpage and found the explainer video especially helpful. I fill multiple roles with Likewise College, which focuses on bringing higher education to prison inmates and their families. Our prison students run their student body tactical and governance sessions very well, but could benefit from your game. We can test the game extensively during the Summer and Fall semesters and provide the feedback you request.</p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">I'm interested in your temporary paper-printout version and would love to explore how some of our incarcerated students might make the specialty pieces and even gameboards using the prisons hobbycraft department.</span></p><p>Thoughts?</p></dd>
