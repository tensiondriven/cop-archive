  <dd><p>Hi Keith,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Holacracy is for people working in an Organization for its purpose on a day to day basis. A volunteer working only 1 or 2 days per week is not a real partner and shouldn't be assigned to a role - meetings takes a lot of time already.</p><p>A contractor works for another company and is not contributing to the same purpose. We had the experience of both and giving them a role (full authority), including them in governance and tactical meetings doesn't make sense and doesn't work. You can't give full authority to someone external.</p><p>The right move would be to assign a partner to a role and then leaving him/her the choice to ask a volunteer or to call a contractor for some projects. He then process tensions directly with the volunteer/contractor.</p><p>For instance, I have a graphic design role but I am not especially good in design, I just hire a sub-contractor, deal with it normally.&nbsp;</p></dd>
