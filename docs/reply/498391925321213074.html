  <dd><p>That's unconstitutional:</p><div class="page layoutArea column" title="Page 12"><p>2.6.4 REP LINK TO SUPER-CIRCLE</p><p>Each Circle normally elects a Rep Link to its Super-Circle. However, this election is not required when a Circle lacks any Core Circle Members other than those serving as Lead Link and Cross Links into the Circle. In this case, even if the election is conducted, the elected Rep Link does not become a Core Circle Member of the Super-Circle.</p></div></dd>
