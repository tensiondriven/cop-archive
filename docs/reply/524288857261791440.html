  <dd><p>You can't represent someone else's tension - it's unconstitutional in any case, and, as Tracey discovered, a terrible idea to try! &nbsp;:-)</p><p>You can represent someone else's role, with permission, to process a tension you sense in that role, which is a totally different thing than representing someone else's tension. &nbsp;I think that's what Gabriella was intending to ask about, although there's nothing that allows&nbsp;a role to be "represented by another role", just by another partner. &nbsp;And then they can represent the role just as if they filled it, and process any tensions they actually sense in the role.</p><p>There are no rules about how/when that permission is given, so it's up to everyone involved to use their judgment there. &nbsp;I often use this when I'll miss a governance meeting, and I know someone else who will be present has a good sense of my roles, so I invite them to represent my roles so they can raise objections from them if needed. &nbsp;You could also use it when someone senses a tension&nbsp;that limits your role, which you also sense but think for whatever reason that they'll do a better job resolving&nbsp;the tension than you would (e.g. perhaps they used to fill the role for a long time and you're new to it).</p></dd>
