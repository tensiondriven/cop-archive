  <dd><p>That does help a bit Chris. I'm thinking that the whole <em>'as long as that does not decrease the clarity'</em> phrase sort of inherently brings with it a strong argument again co-assigning (or allowing to remain co-assigned, in this instance) the role of lead link. But that it is not specifically precluded until such non-clarity is brought as tension and/or then additionally clarified by use of 'focus'&nbsp;identifying which partner is filling which accountability.</p></dd>
