  <dd><p>I find that my humor is pretty much always present, and I can feel free to be myself and express it at different times...when the circle is comfortable enough to engage in process without feeling too scared or shut down about learning the rules...or even when they are, but we have a rapport. I can't manufacture humor much, but I find that smiling and feeling free to laugh helps a lot Rebecca...depending on your culture, you can also wear zany stuff (like I do outside of meetings anyway) to lighten the mood. Curious to hear others' thoughts too.</p></dd>
