  <dd><p>Hi all, thank you for your interesting posts and thanks for sharing your experiences. In our study about Holacracy we also want to put insights into the pitfalls - so @Imrane and all others: Is it possible to include you in our study? We want to start in fall '17. However, the study only starts if the crowdfunding for it is successfull (<a href="https://www.startnext.com/en/holacracy" target="_blank">https://www.startnext.com/en/holacracy</a>). So, if you want this study to be real and want to share your knowledge and solutions and make it possible for others to learn from your experiences, I am happy to count on your support. Of cours,e you can contact me through pn or <a href="mailto:anne.maigatter@fhnw.ch">anne.maigatter@fhnw.ch</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
