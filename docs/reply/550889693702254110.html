<p>Hi Keith,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone can object “Invalid proposal” per 3.2.4 (e)* and then, in integration, the Facilitator will have to verify the validity of the proposal by asking them questions like: which of your role is limited by this tension? can you give a concrete situation? per 3.2.6 (c)**.</p><p>So my take on it: anyone can test the proposal during integration and if the facilitator sees it doesn't meet the criterias, he has to abandon&nbsp;it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>*3.2.4 (e)</p><p>However, regardless of the above criteria, a Tension about adopting a Proposal always counts as an Objection if:</p><ul><li><strong>(e)</strong> Processing or adopting the Proposal breaks the rules defined in this Constitution, or prompts the Circle or its members to act outside of the authority granted under this Constitution. For example, Next-Actions, Projects, and specific operational decisions are typically not valid Governance outputs per the terms of <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art31">Section 3.1</a>, so anyone involved could raise an Objection that a Proposal to enact these outputs would violate the rules of the Constitution.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>**3.2.6 (c)</p><ul><li><strong>(c)</strong> Any Core Circle Member may ask the Proposer clarifying questions about the Tension behind the Proposal, or about any examples the Proposer shared to illustrate the Tension. If the Facilitator concludes that the Proposer is not making a good faith effort to answer those questions at any point, then the Facilitator must deem the Proposal invalid for processing and abandoned.</li></ul>  </div>
