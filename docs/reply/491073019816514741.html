(caveat: not a certified Coach here, at least not yet :-)</p><p>Role authority is not limited to accountabilities, it includes purpose, projects may be linked directly to the purpose, if one exists, &nbsp;(even if the accountabilities it implies are not spelling out every possibile bit and nuance of how the purpose may be expressed), in fact as per <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art11" target="_blank">article 1.1</a> a role may have a purpose and zero accountabilities, and it would make sense for it to be able to take on projects to serve it.</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art13" target="_blank">Article 1.3</a>: "As a Partner assigned to a Role, you have the authority to execute any Next-Actions you reasonably believe are useful for enacting your Role’s Purpose or Accountabilities.", (I was focusing on that OR )</p><p>That said, when you act outside your role, and therefore perform &nbsp;Individual Action, it &nbsp;doesn't always&nbsp;imply&nbsp;governance consequences, <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art43" target="_blank">article 4.3</a> shows examples of&nbsp;situations in which you may perform individual action and nothing needs to be addressed in governance.&nbsp;</p><p>all this to say that the link from tactical to &nbsp;governance is realized&nbsp;only through tensions (logging a tension to be processed in governance is one of the output of the tactical meeting) , and there is no implicit or necessary correspondence between projects and subsequent governance fixes, nor there is a need to bring to governance any possible instance of a project the assignement of which wasn't clarely addressed in the realm of a role scope as Jeffrey pointed out.</p><p>another subtle link exists in the opposite direction, one may take on a project or action during a Governance meeting provided:</p><p>a) the project or action is not logged in the output of the meeting (that would break <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art324" target="_blank">article 3.2.4</a>)</p><p>b) the project assignement is somehow immediate and doesn't interrupt the flow of the meeting (hijacking it&nbsp;&nbsp;into a tactical ;-) &nbsp;as per <a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art337" target="_blank">article 3.3.7</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ciao.</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
