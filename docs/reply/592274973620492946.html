  <dd><p>Michael,&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks again this is very helpful. I took a quick look at the Peakon/Office Vibe tool.</p><p>Did you consider other tool options?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am in the process of assisting in the formation of&nbsp; COPs of Sr. Executives and looking for a tool to establish a baseline and measure success. The companies I work with all are established or highly ranked companies with which to work. That said in all cases the employees or colleagues with most time seniority at the companies consistently grade the company lower across the board on the great company surveys. We are looking for tools and other metrics to assess our progress beyond or in addition to the great companies to work surveys.&nbsp;</p><p>In a sense we are looking to identify the drivers and behaviors necessary to improve engagement. Has your tool and process achieved what you hoped?&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever else you can share about what you've learned and the process is greatly appreciated?&nbsp;</p><p>All good stuff.&nbsp;</p></dd>
