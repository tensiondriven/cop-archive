  <dd><p>Wow, great ideas - we did in fact use the 'private chat message to Facilitator' approach and it worked fairly well, except one of our members was on via phone, so we had him state verbally, after all the texts were received, then the Facilitator asked him the 'why' question first. &nbsp;Not too bad. &nbsp;</p><p>I also like Tyler's Google form - I'm using those a great deal in other contexts and will discuss it with our new Secretary.</p><p>That's right - you heard it here first - I've been Secretary since Aug 2014 and am no more. &nbsp;Anchor Circle Facilitator at your service!</p></dd>
