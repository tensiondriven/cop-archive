  <dd><p>I can add our (a Swiss/German 250 people E-Business company who ratified the constitution end of March 2017) personal experience: for us&nbsp;it was mainly two things:</p><p>a) the&nbsp;personal transformation and a strong will and commitment of the whole management&nbsp;board - getting familiar with the ideas behind (Laloux helped a lot) and continuously convincing/assuring/motivating each other that this is the right step for us to get&nbsp;a more dynamic, client-focused and successful company</p><p>b) a good&nbsp;prepared and executed 3-months planning phase (e.g. defining an&nbsp;initial structure and the most important Apps) to build knowledge and trust before starting with the new system</p></dd>
