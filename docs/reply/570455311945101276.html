  <dd><p>Hey&nbsp;[@mention:471649920894755840]</p><p>You could test this objection using question #4 &nbsp;- "does it limit one of your roles?" - and it would probably help as facilitator have the objector get really clear on what the harm is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the role</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Couple of extra thoughts:</p><p>&nbsp;- "for me personally" - definitely doesn't sound like a valid objection!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- "it will affect my performance" - sounds like there could be some validity&nbsp;in here (IE there could some harm being done to a role - a role is left less able to express its purpose) - but at the moment it's not clearly specified, and it's tangled up in the personal objection. So use the process to tease the two apart.</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>Best wishes, Andrew&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
