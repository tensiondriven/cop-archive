  <dd><p>Hi Margaux, fully resonate with the topic of your post because it's been my lifestyle for quite a bit now. Besides&nbsp;others' contributions, I'd like to give you my 2 cents on one thing you've written&nbsp;"[co-working space] doesn't create value for the company as interactions are outside of the company":&nbsp; you can't imagine how&nbsp;many insights and (direct or indirect) leads/deals I got from interacting with others at a co-working space. If budget is the real concern, note&nbsp;that I have a group of local people (solo self-employed&nbsp;like me) I work with once a week, and we show up depending on who is available and we pick a new location each time (someone's home, a café, their office space).</p></dd>
