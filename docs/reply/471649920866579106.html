  <dd><p>Hi Nick,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just want to give a though on this: the Anchor Circle has by default the domain of&nbsp;Partner Relationships (per constitution article 5). In case of H1, it has been delegated to the GCC so the GCC can govern the Partner Relationships, define policies, etc..</p><p>I would love to have the complete answer from Brian, this is a tricky question. Could you record the webinar as I won't be able to attend? Last time, there were not enough space to record it on Bluejean...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p></dd>
