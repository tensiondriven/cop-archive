  <dd><p>Dear Keith and Pam,</p><p>You are right! Here is the link to what originally aimed me toward the 3-Tier Partnership App:</p><p><a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/17498" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/17498</a></p><p>It covers the way that Structure and Process define the Purpose, Domain and Accountability in relation to partnering, and Community Members are their third kind of partner. From this I went to the more formal Holacracy App, and downloaded it, with the intention of taking into account that schema too, so that,&nbsp; with the appropriate tweeks, I can produce a system which would fit my organisation.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Ian</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
