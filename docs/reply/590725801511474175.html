  <dd><p>[@mention:577633875651499938], we've been running Holacracy since November 2016 and distributing the values-mindset can be a challenge. The focus on "purpose" helps align new personalities in the organization. My challenge was that as co-founder and vision-bearer, all these values were in my head and meant something specific to me. Getting the values out of my head helped others, since they cannot sense my gut...</p><p>The Bain list is field tested from the consumer PoV and provides common language and definitions for internal conversations. The Storybrand framework also provides a process for embedding values in the organization's external and internal conversation. My frustrations have decreased since getting the values out of my head/gut and trusting others in the organization&nbsp; to discuss and evolve the expression of our values.</p><p>I look forward to hearing more from you as you tackle this crucial element.</p></dd>
