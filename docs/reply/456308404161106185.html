  <dd><p>Howdy and welcome, Leanne! &nbsp;Great question... trying to imagine some game aspects to GlassFrog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Folks, Leanne is a great sport who tolerated some fun-but-nasty role-playing from my snarky alter ego (which another teammate Melissa named "Kevin") - and yes our whole team was ultra-competitive, striving to 'win' the game in a competition that only existed in our minds. &nbsp;And yes, we won, of course. &nbsp;Our version of the simulation company Hygean at the Holacracy Practitioner training in Philadelphia created far more revenue than the other teams did, many who failed to meet payroll as they were locked up in process confusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HYGEAN4 RULES BABY!!</p></dd>
