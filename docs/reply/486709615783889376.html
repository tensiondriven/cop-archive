  <dd><p><strong>@Oliver:</strong> So I'm pretty sure she was objecting on behalf of the circle as a whole and&nbsp;circle members (not roles per say, including hers), so her objection likely would've borne out as invalid. Would the Lead Link be able to object on behalf of the circle though since their purpose is "The Lead Link holds the Purpose of the overall Circle"? In other words, is objecting on behalf of the circle the same thing as objecting for their role as the Lead Link?</p><div><hr /></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>@Paul:</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote><p>For example these might require 3 or 4 governance steps to do address these tensions. For example, create a new role, remove an accountability from another role, give it to the new role, and create a policy applying to the whole circle.</p></blockquote><div>In case you don't know, a proposal in governance can include multiple parts, so all of these changes could be accomplished in a single proposal.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><blockquote><div>I gather from this thread that anyone can sense and process tensions on behalf of the whole circle, although only the lead link can object on behalf of the whole circle.</div></blockquote><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I don't think that's the case - circle members can only process tensions and object on behalf of one of their roles. The question I have is (see above) "is the Lead Link objecting on behalf of the circle the same as objecting on behalf of their role?"</div></dd>
