  <dd><p>Totally agree with&nbsp;[@mention:456308404149183518]&nbsp;. Sometimes an organizations' members feeling comfortable with identifying tensions, takes a very long time.</p><p>I think one key thing is champions in organization who "get it" -- the real meaning of tensions and importance in resolving -- &nbsp;to regularly bring them. Once you see what can be accomplished through the discipline of the meeting structure to protect the space of the tension-holder, and that the tension is resolved when the tension-holder says it is, it can be recognized as a very powerful tool for anyone in the company, and a great avenue&nbsp;to getting new and innovative ideas couriered forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
