  <dd><p>Hello</p><p>I love it, people need such a reminder.</p><p>I think it could be stronger if you mention two words,</p><p>1- your ideal<br />You have the responsibility to reach your ideal way to achieve your role.<br />I refer to "1.2.1 PROCESSING TENSIONS<br />You are responsible for monitoring your role and your ability to express your vision, to identify gaps between the current reality and a potential sense (each gap is a "tension"). "</p><p>IMO, this definition of a tension embeds&nbsp;the deep sense of holacracy. People do not have the opportunity to express their tension, they have the responsibility to reach their own ideal !!</p><p>2- your duties</p><p>It's a sensefull word, close to "accountability", i refer to "4.1 DUTIES OF CIRCLE MEMBERS"</p></dd>
