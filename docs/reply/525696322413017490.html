The question thats surfaces to me, is whether those roles in such circle are part of the membrane of GCC (Purpose, Domains, Accountabilities) or is that a bunch of activities that were simply attached to a hierarchical manager as often the case in large companies running the conventional way. I assume it's the latter... and now I think get your original question.</p><p>You could create a Super-Circle including the actual GCC + such Circle at the same level - because reality sounds like there are two different sub-holarchies here.... related to the same ex-manager</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
