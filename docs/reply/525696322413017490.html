  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Xavier BoÃ«mare posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>Hi,</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. To give you more insight of that situation : The upper circle is the GCC.</p><p>1. Historically speaking, some roles in that circle are not really connected together (was already the case in the previous hierarchical situation) and some are not in&nbsp;the heart of the GCC main purpose</p><p>2.&nbsp;Some of those roles became big enough to be mutated into circle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p>Much clearer with such framing, thanks ! The question thats surfaces to me, is whether those roles in such circle are part of the membrane of GCC (Purpose, Domains, Accountabilities) or is that a bunch of activities that were simply attached to a hierarchical manager as often the case in large companies running the conventional way. I assume it's the latter... and now I think get your original question.</p><p>You could create a Super-Circle including the actual GCC + such Circle at the same level - because reality sounds like there are two different sub-holarchies here.... related to the same ex-manager</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
