<p>Hi Tyler,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think it is very valuable for someone new to the company to participate in such an Integrative Election Process because it allows to have feedbacks on other circle members.&nbsp;I think it is powerful to hear what people&nbsp;thinks of each others, even if the new partner doesn't really know who to elect.</p><p>From a constitution point of vue, if the person is a core circle member, you can't decide to exclude that person from the meeting. However, what we usually do is to propose them to be an observer at e&nbsp;first meeting just to get a sense of what Holacracy is about and the person can decide to participate or not. If you want to exclude the person from the meeting, as a Lead Link don't assign that person to roles.</p>  </div>
