  <dd><p>Thanks for the quick replies.&nbsp; Our habit had been that Lead Link proposals were tested like any others.</p><p>The question had really stemmed from the idea that as a LL, I am able to "...better express ... an Accountability..." (i.e., the accountability to structure governance of the Circle) by making a proposal, therefore all of my proposals are valid by default.&nbsp; However, it is the act of proposing--not the governance itself--that helps the LL better express that accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;[@mention:544274267239861666], your reminder helped me make that connection.&nbsp; Thanks.</p></dd>
