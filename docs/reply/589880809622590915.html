  <dd><p>Many thanks for your responses,&nbsp;[@mention:550748956143473957]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:566373176679980161]. For some reasons, it took me 20 min to see that removal box while I was already navigating in the upper circle when I asked my question ;-) I start to wonder if the "box/button" was visible the first time I looking for it. Anyway, I think it's a useful thing to have a support article on it! Thx.</p></dd>
