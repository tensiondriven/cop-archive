  <dd><p>Tom: &nbsp;I'd actually just wait to the right moment/pause during amend &amp; clarify (or take a time-out if I couldn't find one) and then quietly tell the Secretary that it's okay for the Secretary to add the -ing on the end of verbs&nbsp;for the proposer, and ask that they just do it. &nbsp;I really love it when I have a&nbsp;skilled secretary that just&nbsp;does that&nbsp;without me the facilitator even needing to ask...</p></dd>
