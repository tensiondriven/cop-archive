  <dd><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Five conventional structures guide the way we organize routine interactions and how groups work together: presentations, managed discussions, open discussions, status reports and brainstorm sessions. Liberating Structures <strong>add 33 more options</strong>&nbsp;to the big five conventional approaches.</p><p>[@mention:449833773917801859], Liberating Structures has a menu of 33 Structures that liberate. They are not exactly built as Holacracy Apps yet but I think there is potential that many of these could be adapted to become apps. Here is the link to their "menu".&nbsp;<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls/" target="_blank">http://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls/</a></p></dd>
