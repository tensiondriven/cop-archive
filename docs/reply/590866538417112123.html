  <dd><p>Hi Paul</p><p>Thanks for these thoughts. I fully appreciate that my broad question is best answered with a broad reply. What you say is sensible and very true. It jibes with my own view that there's no straight line to follow here (or anywhere else, for that matter). Making connections and crossing paths with others will open me to others, some of whom may have a need that I can help with.</p><p>I will certainly be in touch should I ever find myself doing holacracy work. Similarly, I've a lot of mgt/leadership/personal effectiveness stuff in my head as a result of designing and facilitating for years. Feel free to 'ask me anything' too -&nbsp;my main email is <a href="mailto:greg.hoehner@gmail.com">greg.hoehner@gmail.com</a></p></dd>
