  <dd><div class="quoteHeading">Thank you for your feedback, Rebecca! Yes, it could get complicated with all the posts and threads all in one forum. At the moment we aren't able to modify or expand the search feature. As the general forum expands and evolves we will create focused forums and consolidate posts/threads in them. &nbsp;The tags are also a tool that can be used by a Member to add specific tags relevant to the content in their posts. &nbsp;</div><div class="quoteHeading">&nbsp;</div><div class="quoteHeading">Originally Posted by Rebecca Brover:</div><div class="quotedText">I'd like to request a more robust search feature on the new CoP. While the directory and tags will help as the content populates, I sense a tension about the ability to rapidly search for terms, names and topics.<br /><br />I think, as the content expands in our community, it will be invaluable to search for specific topics without scrolling through the directory.<br /><br />I hope this is possible and thank you for your consideration!</div><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
