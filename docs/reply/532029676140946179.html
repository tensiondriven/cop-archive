  <dd><p>Hi, Philippe:</p><p>One way that we bridge this is to not use Holacracy terms at all when communicating with those who are not familiar with Holacracy. We also don't run Holacracy style meetings with them.</p><p>I use the word issue/problem in place of tension, team/group for circle, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I sometime suggest that a meeting be run by a facilitator so the meeting can run effectively. I would also suggest that when we need to decide something and we are deadlocked, let's try to uncover the reasons behind our positions and to have both sides consider the other side's reason and try to come up with solutions for each other. This is basically a lighter version of IDM when it's needed. Most of the time it's not needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
