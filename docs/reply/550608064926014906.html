To make it consistent, you'd want some employee agreement (maybe part of the contract, or something agreed on <em>personally</em> before hire) that they will personally follow the rules defined by the Office role or circle for example. And it'd be a good idea to have a role in this circle representing the employees — like an "Employee Cross Link" or something. An <a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/roles/8521354" target="_blank">example here</a> from HolacracyOne.
