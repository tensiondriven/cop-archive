  <dd><p>Great discussion.&nbsp; We work with contractors and have struggled with how to incorporate their voice effectively in the holacarcy system.&nbsp; Our contractors fill roles like "trainer" but in a "piece work" type model.&nbsp; With that in mind it is challenging for us to expect that they&nbsp;would take part in governance given their sometimes peripheral involvement in all of our meetings and "organizational clarification/restructuring" exercises. In the past we have had a "rep for a multi filled role" that was responsible for listening to contractors in their given role.&nbsp; The challenge we have found is that we are unclear if contractors are seeking out that rep. We have also invited contractors to meetings (tough because it is unpaid work).&nbsp; In both of those examples we have an assumption that a contractor will reach out to express their tensions. Lately we are leaning toward creating a "contractor liaison" type role whose job it is to actively engage contractors about their&nbsp;tensions&nbsp;and then to process them on&nbsp;their behalf.&nbsp; It is not ideal but it helps us to ensure their voice is head without putting an unreasonable burden on them to learn a new system.&nbsp; I expect we would do something similar if we had volunteers.&nbsp;We have not implemented this process yet but it is where we are moving. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[@mention:577211662873788485]&nbsp;reply is great because it contrasts the level of commitment that people might have in various roles.&nbsp; It sounds like you have a cadre of willing, motivated and extremely committed volunteers who are clear on some significant expectations in their role and have signed up for those expectations.&nbsp;[@mention:454478741268114544]&nbsp;might have similarly committed volunteers but this is a new expectation that has not been clearly defined at the beginning.&nbsp; Then the question is one of priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside form their role (or as part of it) how important is a knowledge of holacracy?&nbsp; In&nbsp;our case,&nbsp;it is probably meaningless to some of our contractors and tangentially interesting to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are begging to feel like they donâ€™t need to be directly engaging with holacracy processes-rather we need to adjust our processes to engage them (by reaching out and having routine check-ins). This means the liaison role translates their needs and wants into tensions to be processed and reports back to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
