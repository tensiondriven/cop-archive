  <dd><p>Off course it is hard to be both Facilitator and Circle Member at the same time. This requires learning and time. That is why I recommend to start with an outside Coach or Facilitator that helps you to understand the rules of the game and helps you play the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Question? What is the knowledge level of Holacracy in your organization. Has anyone attended the Practioner Training or did you start with DYI based on the book and the references on Holacracy.org.</p></dd>
