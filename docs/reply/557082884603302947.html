  <dd><p>Dear&nbsp;Eliana,</p><p>dear Angela,</p><p>thank you both for your advice, comments and links. I will check out both in more detail. What I like about MTO is that it does not add another language and theory onto the organization. That is one aspect I found challenging with the Spiral Dynamics or Wilber's theory. Especially with Wilber I have not done enough research to be able to assess the validity of his theory. I am hearing very mixed things. In the case studies for my book, I have found those who find value in it and those who believe that is mystifies self-organization&nbsp;instead of making it accessible to people.</p><p>Thank you both!</p><p>Florian</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
