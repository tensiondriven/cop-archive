  <dd><p>Giuseppe,</p><p>The subtle, but important, difference in Chris' and&nbsp;Jean-Michel's example is that the project owner is managing the work, not the roles. &nbsp;Roles with clear accountabilities&nbsp;that allow others in the organization what to expect from the role-filler.</p><p>Additionally, as you know, role-fillers are obligated (via the constitution) to accept actions and projects that are aligned with their role's purpose and/or accountabilities.</p><p>- Dennis</p></dd>
