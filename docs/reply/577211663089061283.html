  <dd><p>Hello Jen, cristal clear. According to the rules in the Constitution your statement is correct. 2.3.1. states that each elected Rep Link to the Circle becomes a Core Circle Member of that Circle and 2.5.1 states that all Core Circle Members are eligible for election.</p><p>Off course in real life this would be odd. The Rep Link represents the Circle in the Super Circle and needs have to good knowledge of what is happening in this Circle to process Tensions in the Super Circle as well as provide insights on the Metrics. Guess only attending as a Rep Link from the Sub Circle does not bring you these insights. But in the end it is not NVGO and safe enough to try.......&nbsp;<img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" title=":)" /></p></dd>
