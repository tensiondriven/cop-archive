  <dd><p>[@mention:568484858377802720]. If you check art 1.4 you see that you can make any policy for your Domains without consulting others. The only obligation is that you publish it in an open space so that everybody who is impacted knows about it.</p><p>What you can use for this is the notes section of the Circle. This way all Circle Members get a notification around it. Or you set up a system outside of GF where you have to publish all new Policies.&nbsp;</p></dd>
