  <dd><p>This thread is fascinating to me.<br />I have a small (for profit) business in which my customers sometimes want to help out. It is great that they are willing to donate their time and resources, but it can be frustrating trying to manage them. I don't want to hurt their feelings or reject their valuable help, but they seem to expect my attention and support whenever it suits them, since they're doing me a favor. I'm often pulled away from other tasks to answer their questions, make minor decisions, or approve minor expenditures. And these are often for tasks that are low on my list, but are obvious/important to them. Can holacracy principles help me to utilize this resource without it driving me crazy?</p></dd>
