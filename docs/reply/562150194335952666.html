  <dd><p>Hello&nbsp;[@mention:550748956143473957], I'm building also a multi-timezone remote team.<br /><br />My biggest question so far is the <strong>onboarding process,</strong> when you get new remote team members (so haven't met these ever face to face).<br /><br />I'm wondering if there are best practices or some kind procedure to follow, so you can ensure that people really engage to this Holacracy model. So have you found or invented any?<br /><br />So it would be anyway more upfront investments from me, because I have to hire these people and let them to study and internalize this stuff before things are getting businesswise on a productive level.<br /><br /><br /></p></dd>
