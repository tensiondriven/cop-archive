  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:575944726524854281]!</p><p>Thats a great topic. Like others I generally also feel that rolling out full Holacracy to a small org. can be difficult. I have one company that is about 6 people and I advise and coach small business owners who are scaling their org. and are not open for full roll-out. What&nbsp;I&nbsp;sometimes do is a kind of "Holacracy Light" version to keep things more tight and directed. Below is the list of "must haves" I usually do as a starting point:</p><ul><li>list of roles their purposes and accountabilities <ul><li>sometimes&nbsp;I do it even in a simple excel file, keeps everyone on track what's important and why, how many different things we have on our plate so it also act's as kind of "capacity tracking" for reality-check</li></ul></li><li>a simple meeting pulse + GTD for various level <ul><li>I set up a weekly or bi-weekly simplified regular&nbsp;tactical/goveranance meetings for various levels (kind of circles) of roles (usually two main levels: owners and project leaders where there are business and product decisions) .</li><li>of course all project and next-action must be capture in a simple GTD-style doc either in Trello or just plain Word Doc</li></ul></li><li>purpose of company is a MUST</li></ul><p>It's more for a start-up setup intended to scale to a more mature adoption in the future.
