  <dd><p>I started learning Holacracy in April and adopted on October 1st 2015. I realize that I am new to Holacracy however I believe that I could offer a solid perspective in the issues list in the github repository. &nbsp;Should I feel free to comment there or should I refrain? I guess I would like some clarification on your caveat in the original post.</p></dd>
