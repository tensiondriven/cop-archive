  <dd><p>Hi Margaux, Bernard Marie,</p><p>Thanks for your reply. This "issue" is related to timeline in fact. We have policies that we wanted to apply to specific circles according to their maturity. Naming the concerned circles in the policies was the easiest way for now. For instance some circle's LL are elected.</p><p>It was initially done on sub-circle.</p><p>However we had a proposal that added a layer so we ended up with policy targeting sub-sub-circles, and then I was wandering if that was an issue or not.</p></dd>
