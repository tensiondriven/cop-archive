  <dd><p>HI Margaux,</p><p>From my perspective, LL's objection would be not valid, as it refers to allocating resources within the circle. Just same as "I object to add accountability to a role I fill already because I won't have time enough to do it..."</p><p>The role is created to better express the purpose of the company and add clarity to the organisation. This is a minimal step formard, even if the role remains uncorrectly filled.</p><p>Happy to share your thoughts,<br />Best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
