  <dd><p>Fajar, the LL takes the project from the Super circle into the sub circle. It is the LL role to make sure that it gets done. How the process is set up in the sub circle is up to the sub circle. The LL can put it on the project board of the sub circle and this way gets info to report in Super circle if needed or just talk with the role that is responsible for it in the sub circle.</p></dd>
