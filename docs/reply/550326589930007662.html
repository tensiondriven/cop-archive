  <dd><p>[@mention:455886150941203371]&nbsp;I like it. I know that my guidance above lacks a bit in terms of what the Facilitator should do or say exactly â€” it's more of a guideline for the participants, and I leave it to the Facilitator&nbsp;to then say the right things to help participants follow these guidelines. So&nbsp;it could be better at telling the Facilitator exactly how to facilitate.</p><p>It's not easy because it's so contextual. That said, the framing of the open discussion by the Facilitator is the one things that's not too contextual, so yeah, I agree with you <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /> I'll add something along these lines</p></dd>
