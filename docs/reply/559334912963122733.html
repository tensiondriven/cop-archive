<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>An update:<br />I’ve just completed a final hand-in of my MDes thesis document called “Learning Holacracy Fundamentals Through Play.” The paper documents a year-long design process that explored what&nbsp;Holacracy elements might&nbsp;be extracted and refitted for an introductory board game. The final (v.3.0) design output accompanying the thesis document culminated in&nbsp;“Little Bookcase Publications” – a co-operative board game for up to four players that introduces fundamentals of&nbsp;Holacracy.</p><p>Pasted below is the thesis abstract.</p><p>For those interested in&nbsp;learning more about the&nbsp;game and potentially wanting to further develop future versions&nbsp;with me, you can grab overview information&nbsp;along with a motion graphics video explaining the core mechanics of the game at:<br /><a href="http://www.egillrunar.com/little-bookcase-publications/" target="_blank">http://www.egillrunar.com/litt...okcase-publications/</a><br /><br />For those especially interested in the documentation of the process itself, the&nbsp;theoretical underpinnings behind the process and the overall motivation of creating the game,&nbsp;the following&nbsp;link takes you straight to the university’s repository:<br /><a href="http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/id/eprint/1623/1/Vidarsson_Egill_2017_MDes_DigitalFutures_LearningHolacracyThroughPlay.pdf" target="_blank">http://openresearch.ocadu.ca/i...cracyThroughPlay.pdf</a></p><p>Thanks again to coaches and fellow attendees at the Holacracy Practitioner Training last year for their very helpful feedback on v.1.0. Sorry for the blurring of faces – you needed to be anonymised, according to the university. You know who you are <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>And further thanks to&nbsp;[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[@mention:449833773730792463]&nbsp;for play-testing v.2.0 of the game early this year.</p><p>Looking forward to hear your thoughts and ideas for further work on an introductory co-op board game to Holacracy! <img class="graemlin" height="15" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" /></p><p>Ps. As the thesis document is around 150 pages, a “tl;dr” workaround might be to read the abstract and then the conclusion chapters in the thesis document.</p><p>Abstract:<br />“Little Bookcase Publications” is a four-player co-operative board game attempting to offer an experiential hands-on understanding of Holacracy fundamentals via contextualized simulation. Players act as partners at a small- scale publishing company and learn by role-playing Holacracy-inspired game- mechanics. In the literature review and primary qualitative data gathered via rapid ethnographic fieldwork it became apparent that organizations wanting to implement Holacracy can expect a steep, initial learning curve due to the rule- based – sometimes counter-intuitive – decision-making methods instilled in the method. Insights were gained from the field of organizational development, studies of role performance and play theory along with a design process which started as design-oriented research and then transitioned to research-oriented design. The final aim was to explore what fundamental processes and elements of Holacracy might be extracted to fit an introductory game to ease the learning of Holacracy.</p>  </div>
