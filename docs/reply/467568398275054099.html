  <dd><p>Are you using GlassFrog?</p><p>1. I think it is perfectly "legal" to have different repos; if there is no policy against it, you can use whatever you like.

In Holacracy, if something has a discrete endpoint, or is a result/outcome and takes more than one next action then it is a project, so yeah in those cases!
