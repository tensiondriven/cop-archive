  <dd><div>Thanks [@mention:449693036337664795]&nbsp;and all for such a rich thread. Here’s some additional input which may contribute to mitigating what you are pointing to:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><ul><li><div>Perhaps 4 x 1-week in-person retreats per year aren't enough to provide what you seeking? At&nbsp;HolacracyOne retreats are mostly every other month, usually for approx 9 days including travel. Plus there are additional mini project/circle based in-person gatherings as needed. Although this is expensive in terms of partner time and travel,&nbsp;I understand&nbsp;it’s considered important for supporting healthy inter-personal relationships</div></li><li><div>I know that some people arrange to co-work online to meet the need for more real-time interaction. This means that&nbsp;it’s just a time when partners are working and getting on with their own thing as you do in a co-working space, but they have a zoom meeting open&nbsp;and can chat while they are working.&nbsp;So&nbsp;it’s like the virtual version of co-working. This can be done with 2 or more partners and some people have regular times each day/week when they do this</div></li><li><div>I know some&nbsp;organisations schedule unstructured social time/tribe space for people to hang out and chat directly before/after some virtual circle meetings as a way to create opportunities for more real-time interactions</div></li><li><div>When a lot of communication is&nbsp;asynchronous and virtual like email/slack it can create a&nbsp;sense of disconnection for some people. A way to remedy this is to seek opportunities to schedule real-time calls with partners to communicate about work instead of the asynchronous email/slack messaging</div></li><li><div>This is slightly different but very related on the ‘group-as system’ level- I understand that for human systems to sustain health and vitality over time there needs to be ways for 2-way feedback to be given and received in the matrix of&nbsp;relationships between all people. If the conditions for 2-way feedback aren’t there and the channels aren’t open, it can create a sense of disconnection between people, leading to a feeling that more connection is needed.&nbsp;</div></li></ul></dd>
