The spender is not seeking consensus, or even necessarily feedback. Just giving others a chance to review the&nbsp;intention, ask questions and (if over a certain sum according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://app.glassfrog.com/policies/8230766" target="_blank">Extra Rules</a>) attest to whether or not they'd do the same.</p><p>Nor is it necessarily as exhausting as it may sound.
