  <dd><p>I&nbsp;share the curiosity of&nbsp;[@mention:544274267239861666], more specifically on a&nbsp;truth that seemingly hasn't been addressed in this thread so far:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;in Governance we process *the item on the floor until itâ€™s finished (or we run out of time)* and repeat with as many agenda items as we can.</p></blockquote><p>Is there a constitutional basis for the&nbsp;practice that processing&nbsp;a governance item "takes all needed time" (within meeting timebox)?</p></dd>
