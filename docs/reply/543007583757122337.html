  <dd><p>We use Trello for Tactical and Governance meetings. The Secretary has the Trello board open on a large screen and walks through each item on Facilitator's cue. In&nbsp;Tacticals, tensions raised during&nbsp;metrics and project updates are captured&nbsp;in a simple plain text document next to the Trello board (using macOS split screen mode). Meeting output for Tacticals is also recorded in that same plain text document and e-mailed to all circle members afterwards.</p><p>For Governance records (as opposed to proposals, which are stated on&nbsp;Trello cards), Podio is&nbsp;our database. We have "apps" (Podio language for "tables") for Circles, Roles and Policies. Main advantages are (1) change history (audit trail) baked into the records and (2) ability to create references between Circles, Roles, Policies and people (role assignments).</p></dd>
