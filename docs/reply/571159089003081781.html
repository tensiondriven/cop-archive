  <dd><p>Interesting stuff to ponder - where Shadow Power might be infringing in your interactions with the team.</p><p>One thought here in particular - which respect I ask - what makes you think that as&nbsp;@Secretary&nbsp;you have the accountability to remind people to record their checklist / metric items? I don't see anything about that in the role definition - only that you 'maintain a compiled view'. It's the other&nbsp;@Partners'&nbsp;responsibilities to&nbsp;report on their own items. Nothing in constitution specifies the what how or why of this.&nbsp; It does not require a&nbsp;@Partner to type the entry nor does it require @Secretary to remind them to do so.</p><p>It can be verbally reported during that section of the meeting, then&nbsp;@Secretary records.&nbsp;It might be some self-entry dashboard tool that&nbsp;@Secretary requests the Circle Members to access and utilize - but nothing requires them to do so in advance of the meeting or in any specific way.</p><p>We've bumped up against that a few times, including having a&nbsp;@Partner in&nbsp;one circle wanting a&nbsp;@Secretary in another to&nbsp;record items in a different or specific way, location, etc - but as long as the information is available, there is no means to demand or require specific methodology.</p></dd>
