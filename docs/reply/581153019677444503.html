  <dd><p>I see holacracy as a good effort in the direction of reshaping the kind of "masculinity" that is&nbsp;currently impeding "femininity" to fully express its potential. This is different from trying to inject more femininity into an organization which is "masculine in the wrong way", I see this latter trend as predominant. It's the old: "fix the people and the organization will follow" pattern, that has never worked, and will never work in my opinion.</p></dd>
