  <dd><p>Hi Shahrooz, I'm wondering, are you asking for some kind of networking function within Glassfrog? &nbsp;Would it be a way to contact people in other organizations using Holacracy, specifically organizations with one member?<br /><br />I like the idea of practitioners being able to meet and share ideas. &nbsp;That's&nbsp;part of the purpose of this forum. &nbsp;If it were in Glassfrog, I imagine people would need to opt in to outside communication and it might attract marketing/networking spam. Maybe that would not be a totally bad thing?&nbsp;<br /><br />There are lots of publicly viewable organizations in Glassfrog, though to my knowledge there is not a directory of them so it is&nbsp;difficult to actually find them without a direct link.&nbsp;</p></dd>
