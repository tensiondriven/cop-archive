  <dd><p>If the Lead Link of the super circle wants to do this, it almost definitely indicates something is off - the super circle lead link shouldn't need to know or care how the sub-circle is structured, as long as it fulfills its purpose and accountabilities effectively, within any policy constraints of the super circle.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;whether it's allowed or not is likely a distraction (and no, it's not really allowed) - the real question here is why that lead link feels the need to do it, and the opportunity is to help them figure out what they really need the sub-circle to&nbsp;do (e.g. what accountability) such that they wouldn't care how the sub-circle organizes to do it...</p></dd>
