  <dd><p>Hi Fiona</p><p>1. By default, every core circle member is entitled to participate&nbsp;in&nbsp;governance meetings. You can change this for multi-filled roles:&nbsp;</p><h4><code>2.3.2 Exclusion for Multi-Filled Roles</code></h4><p><code>If multiple Partners are assigned to the same Defined Role in a Circle, the Circle may enact a Policy that limits how many of them are Core Circle Members as a result of that Role assignment. However, the Policy must allow at least one of the Partners filling the Role to represent it as a Core Circle Member, and must specify how that representative will be determined.</code></p><p>2. All partners in a role that controls a domain can access that domain on their own authority. Just as any role in a circle which controls the domain can access that domain. There is no 'making the decision together' - each person gets to decide for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Best wishes, Andrew&nbsp;</p></dd>
