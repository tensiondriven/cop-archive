  <dd><p>Hi Davi,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To add on Bernard Marie's good point and redirect you to the Constitution:</p><h4>2.2.3 Amending the Lead Link Role</h4><p>A Circle may not add Accountabilities or other functions to its own Lead Link Role, or modify the Role’s Purpose, or remove the Role entirely.</p><p>However, a Circle may remove any Accountabilities, Domains, authorities, or functions of its Lead Link Role, either by placing them on another Role within the Circle, or by defining an alternate means of enacting them. When this occurs, it automatically removes the relevant element or authority from the Lead Link Role, for as long as the delegation remains in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For your second question regarding elections:</p><h4>2.5.1 Elections &amp; Eligibility</h4><p>The Facilitator of each Circle will facilitate regular elections to elect a Core Circle Member of the Circle into each of its Elected Roles, using the process and rules defined in Article III.</p><p>All Core Circle Members are eligible for election and each may hold multiple Elected Roles, except for the Lead Link of a Circle, who may not be elected as its Facilitator or Rep Link.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only core circle members can be elected for core roles in a circle.</p><p>Lead Link can't be elected Facilitor nor Rep Link.</p></dd>
