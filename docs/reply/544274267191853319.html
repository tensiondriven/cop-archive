  <dd><p>HI [@mention:542726102746093394]&nbsp;there is no dependency of people from other people in Holacracy. This means that there is no specific skill to be developed, that would by required by&nbsp;any person to specifically deal with personality types of others in order to engage them on the personal level to get things done. &nbsp;That is because in Holacracy you interact by following practice that goes beyond the simplistic: bosses ask --&gt; people do, and not by asking favors or giving orders that require a comprehension of the&nbsp;psychological traits of you counterparts in order to be crafted appropriately and be effective. &nbsp;That said the Holacracy Constitution points out which duties, authorities and expectations each single Partner (holacracy definition of organization member) is subject to. By starting to read those you could get a some understanding of what's expected from a person on a daily basis, to be a good member of an organization running on Holacracy. That could be a starting point for your research.</p><p>I would look at articles:</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art121" target="_blank">1.2.1</a> to 1.2.5</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art13" target="_blank">1.3</a></p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art411" target="_blank">4.1.1</a> - 4.1.2 - 4.1.3</p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art415" target="_blank">4.1.5</a></p><p><a href="http://www.holacracy.org/constitution#art43" target="_blank">4.3</a>&nbsp; (intro only) and 4.3.1</p><p>Andrea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
