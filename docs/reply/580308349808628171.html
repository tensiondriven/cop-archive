  <dd><p>Yes, we use the google calendar to announce meetings, solicit rsvps, and because people mark yes/no for attendance it meets the legal requirement of knowing who is at which meetings.</p><p>Anyone can log in to Glassfrog during a meeting by clicking "Join Meeting" but the glassfrog history doesn't show who signed into the meeting. I will say the glassfrog team is always open to feature requests and you could request that.&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Jenn</p></dd>
