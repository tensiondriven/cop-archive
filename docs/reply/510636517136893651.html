  <dd><p>Yo, Keith!</p><p>As Jean-Michel pointed out, Policies affect what authority you have (either by giving you more, putting restrictions on it, or taking it away). A Policy <strong>allows</strong> or <strong>limits</strong> action, while an Accountability <strong>expects</strong> action. Thus, if a Policy is requiring me to do something, it is NVGO.</p><p>So, if a Policy is put into place, it only affects something specific if I choose to take action. A way we normally explain it is that I should never break a Policy if I sit there and do nothing. If a Policy says, "All Circle Members must do X", that is putting an expectation on me and requiring that I do something, thus it would be an invalid Policy.</p><p>On the other hand, Policies can restrict what's allowed, so a Policy could say, "You cannot hold a Role in this Circle unless you do X", because that is technically just restricting my authority. I can normally choose to hold whatever Role I have been put into, but this is limiting that authority by putting some extra restrictions in place. I wouldn't personally recommend this route unless it's 100% necessary for all Roles to do this.</p><p>Simple solution - Ask the Secretary if they think the Policies worded as they are require action/set expectations. If so, it's NVGO. If it's absolutely necessary for everyone in the Circle to be doing that work, create a Role with everyone in the Circle filling it, add it as an Accountability on that Role. If necessary, you can also add a Policy that says, "In order to hold any Role(s) in this Circle, you must also hold the X Role", with X being the aforementioned Role.</p><p>Hopefully this helps!</p></dd>
