  <dd><p>Heather,</p><p>I can coach the team with the habit if that is intentional, in my experience assigning a project to everyone in the role leads to confusion. I can see where it might be useful but this is more like a 'We can all work on an updated xyz." which just means no one is going to update it. I will coach the team on when it would be helpful to assign a project to multiple people and when it wouldn't. Thanks for the clarifications.&nbsp;</p><p>Jenn</p></dd>
