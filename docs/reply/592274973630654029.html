  <dd><p>[@mention:454478741268114544], I'm curious about your comment that "It is starting to seem like a manifestation of shadow power." In what way does it seem like shadow power to you? Is it just because your custom (to rank urgency in tensions) is not specified in the Constitution or in Governance? Or is there some other aspect that seems wrong or nefarious to you? Are some people consistently getting their tensions pushed to later while others always get theirs addressed right away?</p></dd>
