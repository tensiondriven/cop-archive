  <dd><p>Hi Leo,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Jean-Michel says, you can assign someone to that role with a focus “Back-up of [Nameofthecurrentrolefiller]”. That's up to the Lead Link.</p><p>If you don't want to do that, we have some clients defining policies to state that if a role-filler is absent, he/she must find someone to take his/her roles during the absence. But I think it is powerful to see the back-ups on GF.</p><p>I don't know about your policy because we are specifically talking about persons/role-filler not roles itselves.</p></dd>
