  <dd><p>another way to record official decisions (as mentioned in the thread above) is to process them in a governance meeting as a policy. and hence use IDM.</p><p>its a bit cumbersome. but might work well.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>you have very formal records of the decision</li><li>a "formal decision" is actually a constraint that fits a policy: when you do work on this project / within this context you have to follow the previous made decision X by the circle</li><li>the IDM process prevents consensus decisions in case of more difficult/larger decisions</li><li>you could simply have as a circle a policy that is called "formal decisions for large project X". and every time propose an update&nbsp;for every new decision you like to have included</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NOTE: "decisions" are here intended in the situation of formal governance keeping in corporate/public environments with many stakeholders outside of the circle&nbsp;or even the organization. where it is required to track all the key (hard to change back) decisions the circle has made. a large infrastructure project team is a good practical example</p></dd>
