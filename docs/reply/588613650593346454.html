  <dd><p>Hm, is standard process of solving tensions during governance process of the circle the role belongs to not applicable? Just someone filling that role comes up with a tension and proposition to add policy. We have several developers in a circle (that is one of&nbsp;several roles in our circle), so sometimes one of them brings some tension to governance of the circle and proposes some new policies.</p></dd>
