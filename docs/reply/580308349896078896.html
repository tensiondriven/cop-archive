  <dd><p>@Jasper Rienstra Amazing article from Lisette. Will happily pass on to a couple organizations that are highly attached to the idea of Sociocracy being all they need while they continue to flail with it. Lisette's article is great about how they were so sure Holacracy wasn't good enough and then completely changed their own minds.</p></dd>
