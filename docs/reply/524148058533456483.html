  <dd><p>Hi,&nbsp;[@mention:476716727643924128]:</p><p>Don't have the answers, and am interested to hear some solutions from people who has done this.</p><p>Just wanted to say thank you for bringing this up. &nbsp;It's right there in the accountabilities of facilitator all this time, but somehow it doesn't register quite well in our minds. We have always thought that it only gets triggered when "someone" declares a process breakdown.</p><p>Well, that someone is the facilitator of the super-circle ��. No wonder nobody ever declares "Process breakdown". Nobody ever audits the subcircles in our org.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></dd>
