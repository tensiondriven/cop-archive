  <dd><p>[@mention:449693036337664795]&nbsp;I resonate with the challenge. Shortly after joining H1, I moved up to Pennsylvania to be closer to other H1 partners, so that is one way I tried to address it. We have retreats of course, and I get a lot of that from coaching at trainings, because there are so many other partners there. Just a few things that come to my mind, but I definitely don't have this solved or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></dd>
