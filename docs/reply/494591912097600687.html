  <dd><p>Marlene - I appreciate your self awareness and consideration about whether it is really the best path for you to get involved in this way as a person!</p><p>I often feel the pull to get personally involved and am at times personally impacted by roles doing their work, so it is an ongoing challenge for me to respect the due process and circle boundaries, and also build capacity for the organization by processing my tensions (or realizing I dont need to because there is a role for it).</p><p>Do you know if the Team Event Organiser role has also felt this, and if so, if you have considered supporting (in a peer coach capacity perhaps as individual action) them to process this tension?</p><p>I wonder if going directly to that role, even outside of tactical, may be another path.</p><p>The reason I wonder is sometimes those who are "closest to the work" are best suited to process it. Not sure if this applies in this case.</p><p>You could try showing up in tactical and making a request that is not based in any role, and if others want to hold to the rules, there is a chance you would get re-directed so to speak.</p><p>Other than that, you could try making a request of the lead link of the circle and they may take on the project for their circle, and then "break it down further" by bringing it into the circle meeting themselves.</p><p>Keep us posted on how it is going with this one if you are willing.</p></dd>
