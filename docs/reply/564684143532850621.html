  <dd><p>Hi&nbsp;[@mention:457856795976338607]! Exciting that you are opening an office in Sta Cruz de Tenerife. So that means that you are already using Hola in your organisation in Chile right?&nbsp;<br /><br />Hi&nbsp;[@mention:564965618962193805], welcome then to the Hola community! I only know from a German company client of ours that has 2 offices in Spain using Holacracy. From what I know not that easy. One of basic reasons is&nbsp;the lack of Spanish speaking providers and materials that can adapt the language and guide them through the experience of Holacracy as a cultural and mindset shift.<br /><br /></p><p>I will soon propose some dates to have an online meeting in September <img class="graemlin" src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" title=";)" /></p></dd>
