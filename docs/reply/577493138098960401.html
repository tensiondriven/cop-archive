  <dd><p>Hi Tom,&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; The person is in the circle because they are the elected rep link from the sub-circle. They are in this circle only as the rep link and have no other defined roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, my question is that since they are in this circle only as a rep link from the circle below, are they eligible for elections?&nbsp;</p><p><br />I hope that clarifies it for you.&nbsp; Thank you <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p></dd>
