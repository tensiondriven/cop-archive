<p>This is where the Human Meets Holacracy - and it's not easy for many.</p><p>In a traditional hierarchy, you could</p><ol><li>Go to the Maestro and say 'have, I've had a number of volunteers show up with nothing set up for them to do, and it's eating into my time, OR</li><li>Go to your colleague's supervisor and say 'you know, I've had a number of volunteers show up with nothing set up for them to do. Would you look into the Maestro's productivity?'</li></ol><p>In Holacracy, you could</p><ol><li>Exactly the same as #1 above - you bring your Tension directly to the Role, who is bound/required to process your Tension</li><li>Bring that same Tension to Tactical and say the same thing</li><li>Provide feedback to the&nbsp;@Lead Link about the Role fit and/or distribution of resource that could be affecting the Maestro's productivity</li></ol><p>What I've found in the 3.5+ years of our implementation is that this interaction between colleagues is still one of our biggest challenges.</p><p>I think in many occasions we have found ourselves wondering if/when <em>someone else</em> is going to intervene with colleagues who aren't getting things done.</p><p>What I do know is that there is no 'boss' who's going to come along and handle it for me/us/you - and - that if/when I have a Tension about someone else's non-completion of an accountability, <strong><em>I am actually required by the constitution</em></strong> <em><strong>to process that Tension.</strong></em></p><p>Do I? Sometimes.</p><p>And I have more often than not been the member of the team who points to the rules (constitution), who points to the agreed-upon processes or structure (governance) that we aren't following, and <strong>it. gets. tiring.</strong></p><p>and, a bit lonely sometimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>
