  <dd><p>Hi Jonathan,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is my contribution on this topic "Projects views".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project list view (My Projects)? Do you like it?</em></p><p>Yes I do and I like it, especially for the "Created" sorting tab, which allows me to track what ongoing project has been lasting for&nbsp;too long and deserves to be either revised or split (too big, not realistic and discouraging) or merely&nbsp;energized a bit more, if left aside&nbsp;for too long.&nbsp;I believe dates can be added easily on the grid view anyway...</p><p>Another though is if a LL could access this type of list view for the entire circle, I believe the dates&nbsp;could give a good tool to monitor roles and how they fit the people, and/or if the governance structure is not at its best (role splitting when projects last too long...).</p><p><em>- Do you or your clients use the project grid view (on Circle pages)? Do you like it? How could it be improved?</em></p><p>Yes, I do use it too, when facilitating meetings of course, but also as&nbsp;it gives me a very visual view of all projects, which I love (I'm very visual) by separating them well.</p><p>Although I'd love to be able to slide and drop projects sometimes to re-organize them in regards to changing priorities for the circle, which I can only do with my personal trusted system so far (using OmniFocus).</p><p><em>- If the My Projects tab showed the grid view instead of the list view, would that cause harm? &nbsp;(If so, what specific problems do you think might arise?)</em></p><p>As I said before, I would regret the "Created" tab showing dates, but I could easily adapt to any other view anyway. Also, what do you think of the LL monitoring tool it could become, if "Created"&nbsp;tab&nbsp;and the list view were extended to an entire circle's roles's list ?</p><p>Finally, ss Margaux said, a "My Actions" tab would be a super friendly tab for most people I met, at least this is what I heard from them each time I presented GF. Also friendly for people not used to OmniFocus, Asana, etc, and&nbsp;people not familiar (hating?...) computers... Less to learn, all in one place ! <img src="/static/images/graemlins/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" class="graemlin" /></p><p>Looking forward&nbsp;to discover the future GF features and changes that will come out of this forum...</p></dd>
