  <dd><p>Hi Marco,</p><p>I think with us this just has a bit to do with "Holacracy Maturity". We're not fully there yet when it comes to individual tension resolving - and any step between like going through a rep is making it a bit easier to tell yourself "probably that tension is not that important..." and leave it unresolved.</p><p>I observe the same in when it comes to sub-/super-circle issues, so the "app" might work and we just need time to grow into it.</p><p>For us, it is a problem, as this role basically is the core of our business (Imagine that role being "Lawyer") and it's crucial that tensions are resolved.</p><p>Nico</p></dd>
