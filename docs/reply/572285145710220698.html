  <dd><p>Hi Shammi Nanda.&nbsp;At HolacracyOne, we have people at different levels of time commitment, which we assess in percentage. Basically, sometime full time is at 100%, someone&nbsp;working 4 days/week is at 80%, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>We decide the compensation level based on our badge system — basically a system where people can earn "badges" for the skills they contribute. Some skills are more valuable than others, and different set of badges have different levels of compensation.&nbsp;</p><p>Then if someone is part-time at 80%, they will&nbsp;earn only 80% of the target compensation that their badges can earn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This only for "work contribution", or what would equate to a salary.&nbsp;The founder&nbsp;is compensated under the same system, without extra for being the founder. However, the founder (and others) have shares of the company, for which they&nbsp;earn "dividends" too.</p><p>Hope that helps&nbsp;a bit. Note that the badge system I'm mentioning could be replaced with a simpler approach — my main point was that we determine compensation regardless of time commitment, then we apply the time commitment percentage to that result.</p></dd>
