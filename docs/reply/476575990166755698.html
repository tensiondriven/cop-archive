  <dd><p>Yes, Team P and Team T to be specific. Each team circle belongs to the Delivery circle, which in turn is a part of the GCC. We toyed with no Delivery circle but decided it was necessary for the allocation of work - the Delivery Lead Link is responsible for allocating work to teams (we have an "auto-allocation" policy that expedites this).</p><p>Amongst other roles, each team has a role Developer but with slightly different accountabilities, only one team has a Scrum Master, and only one team has a Tech Support role. One team has most roles multi-filled across the team&nbsp;while&nbsp;other teams have chosen to have more specialisation.</p><p>As a side note, we are using Attention Points (borrowed from HolacracyOne) to give us a better framework to set and discuss&nbsp;time required for each role within a team. It looks good so far.&nbsp;</p></dd>
