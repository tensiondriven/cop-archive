  <dd><p>I think Bernard Marie's suggestion to ask for any <em>other</em> objections is excellent.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to add on more point: in my view, there is no such thing as "having the same objection" as stated in the original question. Objections are <em>personal</em>. They may <em>seem</em> to be "the same", contentwise, but in their nature, they are clearly not.</p><p>It is up to the tension holders to judge wether their objection needs to be raised or not,&nbsp;not to any other person, especially not the facilitator, to judge wether&nbsp;it is "same" or not.</p></dd>
