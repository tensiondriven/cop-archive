  <dd><p>hi suzanne,</p><p>generally this is often used as a "global checklist item" to build useful habits during implementation. such a global checklist item can be added via glassfrog and we typically add the Acc&nbsp;to an implementation support role to add such items.</p><p>Re your question on who can add checklist items for the entire circle: any circle member might do this. however,&nbsp;doing so you have no right to expect that every circle member accepts to report on it. if that seems important to your org you might change the way you handle it, by adopting governance that specifies how it should work in your org.</p><p>helps?</p><p>- Gerald</p></dd>
