  <dd><p>Hi Chris,</p><p>Great initiative!</p><p>2 ideas:</p><ul><li>What about making the cards "<strong>open source</strong>" <strong>and share the cards in a format like ppt</strong> instead of pdf. On the one hand this allows organizations to insert their own alternatives for sentences like "what do you need" that work in the local context and on the other hand allows for&nbsp;adding the own&nbsp;look and feel with a company logo, a matching color scheme etc. These cards are so often used that it would be great to make them something special for the organization. In this way you keep the H1 format (instead of the retrofits I see now) but get a bit more localization included.</li><li>just for general interest: is there a formal difference between constitution 4.0 and 4.1 that is included in the card update? would just love to know.</li></ul><p>Koen</p></dd>
