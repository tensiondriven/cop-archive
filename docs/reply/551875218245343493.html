  <dd><p>Quite some responses indicating there's quite some different interpretations of the constitution related to&nbsp;policies! Nice to see so much input, thank you all!<br /><br />Thank you for your example&nbsp;[@mention:449411339497350002]! I understand that adding policies on circle level is allowed (in super circle's governance if I'm not mistaken?) But what happened in our case is that a policy was added to a <em>role</em>. I'll continue using&nbsp;your case as an example.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0px;">Imagine in the same circle as Website Strategy role there's also a <strong>Web Support role</strong> that, during governance, proposes to add a policy to the Website Strategy role's&nbsp;domain on the Website:&nbsp;</span></p><p>Policy: <em>Web</em>&nbsp;<em>Support role is allowed to add, edit or remove content of website as long as this is communicated with the circle</em></p></blockquote><p>This is sort of what happened in our case.</p><p>From my understanding you can use governance to add a policy <em>to a (sub) circle.</em><br />But my question remains: <em><strong>Is a circle member&nbsp;also allowed to use governance to add a policy to another&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">role's</span>&nbsp;domain?</strong></em></p><p>My interpretation is consistent with the example illustrated by&nbsp;[@mention:450819477777465353]. (Thank you for your reply!) Which means IMO it would <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span> be allowed to use governance to add a policy to a role, only to a circle. What would you say&nbsp;[@mention:449411339497350002]?</p></dd>
