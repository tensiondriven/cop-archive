  <dd><p>Yeah.</p><p>The other thing with nonprofits (at least ours) is we lack the financial resources to hire such an expert. I'm the best we have in-house, we're boot-strapping all of our internal study of Holacracy in combination with free H1 resources and notes from the two trainings I attended.</p><p>Some organization templates about these things - legal agreements, human resources (hire/fire/compensation), financial controls/audit/standards - I think would go a long way towards helping new organizations take Holacracy on, and to do so with more success and less pain.</p><p>They might be more likely to stick to it beyond the 'trough of suck'.</p></dd>
