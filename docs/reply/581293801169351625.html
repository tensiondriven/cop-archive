  <dd><p>[@mention:449693036223847456]&nbsp;[@mention:449833773917801859]&nbsp;Thank you for your replies. If D, so that Lead Link do not object or come up with a new proposal from the Lead Link role. What would you expect to happen?</p><p>D1. Original proposer will face reality, that desired accountabilities in the defined role are not carried out and will come up with a new proposal e.g. to change the role. Tension is: we want something to be done from defined role, which is not done as it is not filled, Lead Link gives lowest priority to the task as he has no expertise to perform it.</p><p>D2. Someone else&nbsp;than original proposer, but not Lead Link, will come with a new proposal to change the role. Tension: same as above</p><p>D3. No reletated proposal will be brought to the governance, role wont be filled for the time being.</p></dd>
