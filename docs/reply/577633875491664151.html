  <dd><p>Dear Ian. Thank you for the link. I also am having the same trouble as Keith Jarvis. I'm not quite sure that any of these: Regular, Tenured, or Core partner quite match a volunteer? Regular Partner seems to be anyone agreeing to follow Holacracy and further the Organization in its goals, which could be volunteer or paid employee. Tenured could apply to volunteers who had been there longer but the $15k investment would have nothing to do with volunteers. Core partner seems like it might match a dedicated leader within a volunteer organization, but not really an average volunteer necessarily. What did you mean by 'Community member'? Thanks. P</p></dd>
