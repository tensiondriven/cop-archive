  <dd><blockquote class="quote"><div class="quote-header">Bernard Marie Chiquet posted:</div><div class="quoted-text"><p>[@mention:532592670943008396]&nbsp;To your question "What would be lacking without Reaction Round?", I would say many things. One is a safe space for people to digest the proposal - some of us need to speak&nbsp;loudly to reflect on something. Another one is a safe space again for people who may feel some pressure, kind like&nbsp;some attachment to the proposal, to express the inner pressure they feel. Another purpose which is my favorite, is to help the Proposer by modeling/offering different pathways that may address the Proposer's Tension. And I'm sure they are more into it.&nbsp;</p></div></blockquote><p><span class="" id="result_box">Hello Jean-Marie and thank you for your contribution<br /><br />I understand better the first two added values that you mention (safe space to digest the proposal and to express the inner pressure some people may feel.)<br /><br />The added value that you prefer (to help the Propose by modeling / offering different pathways) is the one that I also prioritized.<br /><br /><span class="">In reading these answers, I come to the conclusion that according to the vision of each, the prioritization varies (the purpose of the reaction turn is for some t<strong>o digest the proposal rather than discovering different pathways</strong> and for others of which I <strong>to discover different pathways rather than</strong></span> <strong>to digest the proposal</strong>).<br /> <span class="">Obviously, both purposes are active in practice.</span></span></p></dd>
