  <dd><p>It is sort of weird - since Holacracy was influenced by Agile, you sort of get many of the principles out of the box. I think that if I was trying to "install" Scrum in a Holacracy team, I would start with setting up the main Scrum roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, Tester, etc. Make Scrum Master accountable for scheduling and facilitating the specific Scrum/Agile meetings (daily standup, sprint meeting, estimation meetings, retrospectives); give Product Owner domain of the product (or dev pipeline - whatever gets you to prioritization) and make Product Owner accountable for sitting with the team (basically being available - in whatever concrete form it takes); and make Developer accountable for showing regular working software to Product Owner and integrating feedback. I think that might be enough to get a team started. We've tried adding a separate role for championing Agile practices, though currently on the GlassFrog circle, that's on our version of Scrum Master, but it seems to be a useful accountability to have out there. Actually, just creating a role that is accountable for integrating Scrum practices into the circle would probably do it. But if you want a bit more structure, then Scrum provides a lot of the roles for you to get you started.&nbsp;</p><p>If it is feasible on your team, I would recommend having separate role-fillers fill Lead Link, Scrum Master, and Product Owner - especially for new teams. If that isn't workable, then treating Scrum Master like Facilitator and keeping it separate from Lead Link is probably best. If you want Facilitator to run Scrum meetings, then you can put Scrum Master in charge of process/agenda, and add an accountability to Facilitator to facilitate Scrum meetings if the process is clear enough that it doesn't limit your Facilitator elections to just folks who are well-versed in Agile.</p></dd>
